      "    \" U.S. Attorney General William Barr and other U.S., U.K. and Australian officials are pressing Facebook to give authorities a way to read encrypted messages sent by ordinary users, re-igniting tensions between tech companies and law enforcement. \",\n",
      "    \"Facebook WhatsApp already uses so-called end-to-end encryption, which locks up messages so that even Facebook can\\u2019t read their contents. Facebook plans to extend that protection to Messenger and Instagram Direct. \",\n",
      "    \"But the officials will ask Facebook to hold off in an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\",\n",
      "    \"Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes,the officials wrote. The letter repeatedly emphasises the dangers of child sexual exploitation to justify their stance. \",\n",
      "    \"Law enforcement has long sought a way to read encrypted messages that analogous to wiretaps for phone calls. Security experts, however, say giving police such access makes messaging insecure for everyone. Redesigning encryption to create backdoors for police also creates vulnerabilities that criminals or foreign spies can exploit, they say. \",\n",
      "    \"Every couple of years, the FBI rears its ugly head and tells us they need to have access to end-to-end encrypted messaging, said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \\u201cYou cannot make a backdoor that only good guys can go through,\\u201d she added. \",\n",
      "    \"Facebook said on Thursday that people have the right to have private conversations online and that companies are already able to respond to government agencies when they receive valid legal requests. \\u201cWe strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere,\\u201d Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement. \",\n",
      "    \"The letter marks yet another salvo in the Justice Department continuing effort to persuade technology companies to weaken or bypass encryption upon requests from law enforcement. \",\n",
      "    \"Former FBI Director James Comey championed the need for law enforcement to find a workaround for encrypted devices and communications. He led a highly publicised push to gain access to an iPhone belonging to one perpetrator of a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people in 2015.\",\n",
      "    \"Apple resisted such efforts and went to court to block an FBI demand for Apple to disable security measures that complicated efforts to guess the phone passcode. While the FBI cast its request as a limited emergency measure, CEO Tim Cook argued that the technique could easily be used again, making iPhone users more vulnerable to spies and thieves. The FBI relented after it found another way of getting into the San Bernardino phone. \",\n",
      "    \"Barr will make the request to Facebook in a letter with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australia Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. BuzzFeed News reported on the letter earlier. \",\n",
      "    \"The Justice Department calls the growing use of end-to-end encrypted communications the ongoing dark problem, referencing the way encryption shields information that law enforcement could previously access easily. \",\n",
      "    \"Barr gave lengthy comments on what he described as a dangerous increase in device encryption at a cybersecurity conference this summer in New York. During his comments, Barr specifically detailed the use of WhatsApp group chat by a drug cartel to coordinate the murders of Mexico-based police officials. \",\n",
      "    \"In announcing plans in March to expand encryption, Zuckerberg acknowledged that the privacy protection it affords extends to he privacy of people doing bad things. He said Facebook was working on better ways to detect patterns of bad behaviour, without seeing contents of messages. \",\n",

The same event also saw the launch of their first smart TV\\u2014 the OnePlus TV, a device that aims to seamlessly connect mobile and home networks for the future of interconnectivity\\n\\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \\nV V Krishnan  \",\n",
      "    \"At the bright-red illuminated interiors of Indira Gandhi Arena (stadium) in Delhi, OnePlus made it amply clear at their September 26 keynote that they\\u2019ve zeroed in on their target demographic and what they really want: entertainment and gaming.\",\n",
      "    \"Zake Zhang, product manager of the smartphone brand, shared worldwide stats of 2,000 vlogs on YouTube every hour, and 400,000,000 watching online video every month. He said OnePlus has made its cameras incredibly stable and easy to use on-the-go. The team also announced that the 90Hz fluid display \\u2014 which makes their phones \\u201csilly fast\\u201d as someone recently put it \\u2014 returns to the OnePlus 7T, making the company\\u2019s inclination towards gaming even more obvious and natural.\",\n",
      "    \"When co-founder Carl Pei closed the keynote, he told the audience \\u2014 who\\u2019d paid a pretty penny to be there that night \\u2014 that what they paid will be compensated on tickets to their Katy Perry and Dua Lipa concert in Mumbai this November. Loud cheers went up at all these junctures.\",\n",
      "    \"For a lot of premium smartphone users, the OnePlus 7T\\u2019s features might not have seemed as revolutionary as they were made to sound that night. Nor would the OnePlus TV and remote have impressed them. But making entertainment-friendly features available at just \\u20b939,999, (the phone) and starting \\u20b969,900 (the TV) spoke volumes of OnePlus\\u2019 commitment to those in their late-teens till anyone in their early 40s.\",\n",
      "    \"In an interview ahead of the launch, Vikas Agarwal, general manager of OnePlus India, spoke at length about doing a major launch in India, their sustained focus on this demographic, and the company\\u2019s bigger plans with the launch of the OnePlus TV. \",\n",
      "    \"Edited excerpts:\",\n",
      "    \"While over 70% of our business comes from global regions, India has been our biggest success. And the launch is our big commitment to the Indian market. The OnePlus TV too is primarily designed and produced for the Indian market. We have timed to launch it before the festival season [in the country], so the latest product is in the market, instead of people having to buy from other inventory clearance sales. As for smartphones, today, OnePlus has a 43% share in the premium segment [devices of \\u20b930,000+]. This is more than the combined share of the next two brands \\u2014 Apple and Samsung \\u2014 in India. And this has been just from online presence. But offline, have less than 10% share. [While] we already have 14 stores live, by the end of this year we\\u2019re looking at 35 stores, and by the end of next year, 100 stores across top 50 cities. Creating an offline touchpoint has become more relevant because we have TV too, now. If it works here, we take it globally.\",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"India has been our pilot market for a lot of initiatives in the past too: our global customer service operations are centred in India; we have our biggest global R&D centre \\u2014 just launched in Hyderabad last month \\u2014 and we\\u2019ve further committed \\u20b91,000 crores for developing this facility. So far, not many brands have focussed their R&D efforts in India. One Plus has also been manufacturing all its devices in India since 2015. This year, we are also looking at exporting from here.\",\n",
      "    \"We\\u2019ve always had challenges in managing our inventory. With every launch, our products have always sold out. We\\u2019ve been conservative, and demand has outgrown the supply we were able to build. Today, we are relatively better, but still have lots to learn. As a company, we are not used to this growth. In the first year, we sold a million units globally. And now, we sell a million units in India itself. We have reached a very different scale. In the smartphone industry, most brands die because of inventory, not because of lack of inventory. That\\u2019s something we are conscious of, and never want to take excessive risk that can question our survival.\",\n",
      "    \"Shenzhen is really the hardware hub of China. It is a lot easier for me to experiment with fifty designs there than anywhere else, and get a prototype in the shortest possible time. That helps us optimise in iterations, adding value to our design capabilities.\",\n",
      "    \"First, at OnePlus, we look at a device usability of three to four years. Even today, a lot of the devices we sold in 2015 are still active \\u2014 perhaps passed on to others in the family, or resold. We keep track of all these active devices. Therefore, fundamentally, there is much less e-waste for our devices, compared to the industry. We also have our own network of 65 exclusive stores, which have a recycle programme. And now, our new buyback programme will help us reduce e-waste and create loyalty around us.\",\n",
      "    \"Our TV\\u2019s future is going to be as a \\u2018smart hub\\u2019. The way we see it is you will need a master device to manage all of your smart devices. The smart TV is possibly the best positioned device for this, because it has a display, it is right in the centre of your house, and you can interact with the TV in multiple ways. We are looking at the smart-home as the broader, key theme, and at the centre of that will be the smart TV.\",\n",
      "    \"In the long term, there will be fewer dominant consumer behaviours, and brands will converge to [cater to] those. We are looking at a smart home OnePlus ecosystem of devices, but focussing on lifestyle and entertainment as key.\",\n",

However, the overall picture was clear. I then tried to translate the blurb of a Malayalam version of RK Narayan\\u2019s The Man-Eater of Malgudi that packed in some dense usages in a single, long sentence. The translation read like a summary of the text, nevertheless meaningful, as if the app applied its own brain to weed out some elements for the sake of simplification. Larger texts, such as name boards, are unpredictable, perhaps due to unrecognisable fonts.

While shorter sentences were impressive with their correctness, longer ones raised some question marks.\",\n",
      "    \"Google\\u2019s voice translation feature came across as a hit-or-miss affair, but largely usable with common sense. For instance, the word \\u2018fare\\u2019 (as in charges) in a test phrase from English to regional was misheard or misread or misinterpreted as \\u2018fire\\u2019 first and then still as \\u2018fair\\u2019 in successive attempts, processing the translation as \\u2018mela\\u2019 in Malayalam, thus completely distorting the semantics.

      "    \"The aforementioned also probably explains why the device is on my wrist for longer durations than before. But given its good looks, I am not complaining. With a sporty white strap that has a perforated design, this version is much more glamorous than its earlier siblings. That said, it\\u2019s not restricted to the boot camp or badminton court alone. The watch is versatile and, much to my delight, fits in just as well in a formal brunch setting or a cocktail party. And what a conversation starter this gadget is: people almost always ask \\u2018what you are wearing?\\u2019, even if they are sporting the most elegant Breitling themselves. The bands of Charge 3 come in different colours: Standard (black or blue grey), Horween leather (plum and midnight blue), Woven bands (charcoal and periwinkle) and Special edition (white band with a graphite case or purple band with a rose gold case). The latter even comes with an additional black band in case you need options.\",\n",
      "    \"On the whole, the design is sleek. It is light and sits snug on the wrist. The font is easy to read and doesn\\u2019t have you squinting and feeling years older. It lets you receive messages, phone calls and emails if you choose. In terms of syncing with my phone, it\\u2019s a lot more hassle-free than the Fitbit Alta. There\\u2019s an all-day real-time sync option that keeps the activities of the watch updated on the app on the phone. My only qualm is the sleep tracker that shows a few abnormalities in terms of hours slept and deep and light sleep.\",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"The battery life is commendable and lasts for up to a week after it\\u2019s fully charged. So if you\\u2019re travelling for a few days, you don\\u2019t have the hassle of carrying the charger along. The watch, like most fitness tracking devices, is like a persistent sibling. It vibrates and nudges when you\\u2019ve been sitting on your bottom for too long. It also encourages you with badges when you\\u2019ve outdone yourself in terms of steps taken. It is for this token of appreciation that on many days \\u2014 when I could have just bullied the youngest in the department to collect my Swiggy order from the gate \\u2014 I\\u2019ve found myself bounding to the gate under the scorching sun to collect my delivery.\",\n",
      "    \"The Charge 3 is water-proof. A big plus point because I\\u2019ve often wondered how many calories I burn when I swim. I finally have an answer. And that also means I need to throw in a few more laps and cut down on socialising during pool time. It also lets you choose from exercise modes such as run, yoga, bike... \",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"And at the end of it all, when you need to slow down and catch your breath, this device lets you do that with its Relax mode and breathing guidance. 3 .2. 1...Okay, time to close my eyes and breathe\",\n",
      "    \"Livia \",\n",
      "    \"In the world of wearables, the design is a huge aspect which we cannot place low on our priorities. After all, nowadays, the customisable factor is everything and tech brands market wearables as an extension of the self.\",\n",
      "    \"The Livia, a menstrual pain-cancelling device, is customisable as far as the skin colour goes. Perhaps the electrode pads which one sticks to their lower abdomen could be the same or even similar colour as the user\\u2019s skin... for those less keen on being super vocal about sporting this device. I had to shove my shirt over it.\",\n",
      "    \"Just like when you switch between Apple or Android, there is considerable acclimatisation in navigating the device. But with the Livia, there\\u2019s no screen so you don\\u2019t need to worry.\",\n",
      "    \"There are some days during my cycle when I find myself panicking at the smallest fraction of a cramp, quickly reaching for the device.\",\n",
      "    \"Like most wearables, the Livia has a battery life users have to be well aware of. Because I was becoming so reliant on the Livia as part of my monthly routine, my charging station at home changed too. I set up a wide adapter with different outlets, including one for my Livia. But what did this tell me? I wasn\\u2019t shy about it, even at work where I\\u2019d hook it up to my CPU. When colleagues would ask what the adorable-looking device was, I\\u2019d be pretty honest about it.\",\n",

      "    \" U.S. Attorney General William Barr and other U.S., U.K. and Australian officials are pressing Facebook to give authorities a way to read encrypted messages sent by ordinary users, re-igniting tensions between tech companies and law enforcement. \",\n",
      "    \"Facebook WhatsApp already uses so-called end-to-end encryption, which locks up messages so that even Facebook can\\u2019t read their contents. Facebook plans to extend that protection to Messenger and Instagram Direct. \",\n",
      "    \"But the officials will ask Facebook to hold off in an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\",\n",
      "    \"Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes,the officials wrote. The letter repeatedly emphasises the dangers of child sexual exploitation to justify their stance. \",\n",
      "    \"Law enforcement has long sought a way to read encrypted messages that analogous to wiretaps for phone calls. Security experts, however, say giving police such access makes messaging insecure for everyone. Redesigning encryption to create backdoors for police also creates vulnerabilities that criminals or foreign spies can exploit, they say. \",\n",
      "    \"Every couple of years, the FBI rears its ugly head and tells us they need to have access to end-to-end encrypted messaging, said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \\u201cYou cannot make a backdoor that only good guys can go through,\\u201d she added. \",\n",
      "    \"Facebook said on Thursday that people have the right to have private conversations online and that companies are already able to respond to government agencies when they receive valid legal requests. \\u201cWe strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere,\\u201d Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement. \",\n",
      "    \"The letter marks yet another salvo in the Justice Department continuing effort to persuade technology companies to weaken or bypass encryption upon requests from law enforcement. \",\n",
      "    \"Former FBI Director James Comey championed the need for law enforcement to find a workaround for encrypted devices and communications. He led a highly publicised push to gain access to an iPhone belonging to one perpetrator of a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people in 2015.\",\n",
      "    \"Apple resisted such efforts and went to court to block an FBI demand for Apple to disable security measures that complicated efforts to guess the phone passcode. While the FBI cast its request as a limited emergency measure, CEO Tim Cook argued that the technique could easily be used again, making iPhone users more vulnerable to spies and thieves. The FBI relented after it found another way of getting into the San Bernardino phone. \",\n",
      "    \"Barr will make the request to Facebook in a letter with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australia Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. BuzzFeed News reported on the letter earlier. \",\n",
      "    \"The Justice Department calls the growing use of end-to-end encrypted communications the ongoing dark problem, referencing the way encryption shields information that law enforcement could previously access easily. \",\n",
      "    \"Barr gave lengthy comments on what he described as a dangerous increase in device encryption at a cybersecurity conference this summer in New York. During his comments, Barr specifically detailed the use of WhatsApp group chat by a drug cartel to coordinate the murders of Mexico-based police officials. \",\n",
      "    \"In announcing plans in March to expand encryption, Zuckerberg acknowledged that the privacy protection it affords extends to he privacy of people doing bad things. He said Facebook was working on better ways to detect patterns of bad behaviour, without seeing contents of messages. \",\n",

Standing at 4.5 feet tall, she is a six-wheel 30 kilogram bluetooth controlled delivery robot that can carry upto 50 kilogram of items in her belly. \\u201c Say hello to Jasper; meet my new friend,\\u201d says a few boys and girls enthusiastically. That\\u2019s when we realise Jasper is the prototype of an Amazon autonomous delivery robot that the children have built. \",\n",

      "    \"Druthi Jallu, Paritosh Sai, Ananya Kappagantu, Anirudh Vijay, Dev Aditya Mohan, Mahidhar Damarla, Ram Tej Alla, Akhilesh Yalamarthy, Sruthi Jallu, Vishnu Chinta and Shyamala Durge Thanush took three months to create Jasper with the supervision of their two teachers Vishlavath Ganesh Kumar and Jana Anvesh. These young minds (aged 8 years and above) were guided by Abhinav Rao, who teaches and creates robotic projects on weekends. These weekly classes helped students share ideas and conceptualise the design. \\u201cStudents should have robotics, theory and practical in their curriculum. You cannot live without them now so you have to be prepared,\\u201d says Abhinav. At the centre, students are introduced to practical robotics with basics of electronics, mechanics and programming. \",\n",
      "    \"Initially the students deliberated on project ideas. Once they decided on making a robot Jasper, it was a three month process that began by determining the height of the robot and its targeted function. The idea was not to make Jasper big as transporting it would have been tough. \\u201cBattery is the energy source and the first thing to plan, followed by controls. It is a blue-tooth controlled module; we can control it like a joy stick,\\u201d points out Abhinav. The sessions were fun and a burst of ideas as they shared their wacky ideas \\u201cOne boy wanted to make a racing car and later one student wanted to put Jasper in the swimming pool to see if its body is harmed. With a limited budget, we couldn\\u2019t experiment with their ideas,\\u201d laughs Abhinav admitting it was difficult to channelise the enthusiasm of the teenagers. \",\n",
      "    \"With mild steel for the body; six wheels sourced from market and an acrylic sheet used to keep it light weight, Jasper cost \\u20b9 1,00,000 (borne by the centre). \\u201cThe eye on it makes Jasper look like a human being and attractive to users,\\u201d he points out. Jasper travels at a speed of 5 kilometre per hour and its storage box is 3 feet by 2 feet and 1.5 feet tall. The group also shows a small ranger robot on which they have tried, tested and learnt its applications. \",\n",
      "    \"Jasper is now a permanent fixture at the centre, enthralling visitors (\\u201cStudents can reassemble it again.\\u201d). \\u201cIn its one-and-half year journey, the Lab has produced a string of young innovators,\\u201d say teachers. Among the student creations are a a food delivery robot (for use at tables in restaurants), a shoe for the blind which beeps when there is an obstacle, and a washing machine, a grass cutting machine, a floor cleaning robot and a low-cost driverless car. Two students, Niranjan and Jaidev Chinda even won a special prize at RoboRav in Japan.\",\n",

      "    \"Despite rising censorship of Twitter posts and accounts on the basis of legal demands from the Indian government, law enforcement agencies and others over the last five years, the lack of transparency behind suspensions, blocked tweets and the practice of shadow-banning has left users angry.\",\n",
      "    \"Between June and December 2018 (the last period for which data is available), Indian government, law enforcement agencies and others made 657 legal demands for content removal, apart from 10 court orders. Overall 2,228 accounts were reported, of which 95 accounts and 114 tweets were withheld.\",\n",
      "    \"Indian demands for content removal were the fourth highest in the world for this period, and have increased 100-fold from the same period five years ago.\",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"When contacted by The Hindu regarding such cases of censorship and the process followed to ensure transparency, a Twitter spokesperson refused to answer specific questions, saying, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons... At Twitter, no one is above our rules. We enforce our policies judiciously and impartially for all users \\u2014 regardless of their political beliefs and background.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"Information on official legal requests made to Twitter under Indian law is published twice a year, the spokesperson added.\",\n",
      "    \"According to Twitter records, many content removal demands from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology simply cited a violation of Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. When Twitter receives such a demand, it usually sends an email notice to the affected user. (Twitter says it does not send such notifications if prohibited from doing so.)\",\n",
      "    \"In August, Md. Asif Khan, a Mumbai-based professional with more than 20,000 followers, received such a notice from the Twitter Legal team, saying the company had received a request from an authorised entity in India claiming that one of his tweets violated the law(s) of the country, without specifying which law was violated, or which agency had made the complaint.\",\n",
      "    \"The cited tweet promoted a documentary made by activists who had visited Kashmir after the abrogation of Section 370, using the hashtags #KashmirSolidarityDay and #KashmirUnderThreat. Twitter said it had not taken any action on the request \\u201cat this time\\u201d, but was informing him of the legal demand \\u201cin the interest of transparency\\u201d. If any action was taken, it would notify the third party Lumen database \\u2014 again, if it was not prohibited from doing so.\",\n",
      "    \"Twitter did not respond to a query on whether the Indian government ever prohibits it from making content removal demands public on Lumen.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cI have received several such legal notices and also been temporarily blocked and shadow-banned by Twitter itself, with no specific reasons given,\\u201d said Mr. Khan. Shadow-banning occurs when Twitter limits the visibility of posts and users.\",\n",
      "    \"In December 2018, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression David Kaye wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey expressing concern about the widespread removal of content related to Kashmir on the demand of the government, which affected Kashmiri journalists and activists among others.\\u00a0\",\n",
      "    \"Sharing the letter on Twitter, Mr. Kaye said, \\u201cPlatforms may be improving but they are often opaque to users whose accounts are suspended or posts hidden from view, especially when under pressure from governments.\\u201d It is this opacity that frustrated social activist and former civil servant Harsh Mander when the Twitter handle of his communal harmony organisation Karwan-e-Mohabbat was suspended for a day last week.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cWe did not receive any notice before the suspension. After we appealed and they restored the account; they sent us a bland statement, saying it was something about multiple hashtags,\\u201d said Mr. Mander. The Twitter statement on the appeal gives no clear reason for the action, but warns that future behaviour violating its rules may result in permanent suspension.\",\n",
      "    \"Ankur Singh, a Noida-based professional and right-wing commentator whose 53,000 followers including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, claims Twitter censorship shows a \\u201cliberal bias\\u201d and participated in a right-wing youth protest outside Twitter\\u2019s India headquarters during Mr. Dorsey\\u2019s visit in February.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cTwitter blocked my account on January 23 without any valid reason, and said it was a permanent suspension,\\u201d he said. After an online protest, Twitter restored his account the following day, saying it was wrongly included with spam accounts, but other right-wingers blocked at the same time are still suspended, he said, adding that he had been shadow-banned during the Lok Sabha elections.\",\n",
      "    \"Unlike legal demands by government agencies, there is no record of content removed or shadow-banned by Twitter itself. Although Twitter users from both extremes of the political spectrum claim that they are being affected by the platform\\u2019s censorship, right-wing users do not get content removal notices on government demand, agreed Mr. Singh. \\u201cWhy will the government take action against their own supporters?\\u201d he asked.\",\n",

      "    \"Design is a confluent term, and Hyderabad Design Week promises to capture how diverse this growing industry is, through their theme \\u2018humanising design.\\u2019 The event will be held in tandem with the 31st edition of the World Design Assembly in the city as well, serving as an extension for those local and from afar. \",\n",
      "    \"A couple of years ago, IKEA made its foray into India which stimulated an all-rounding conversation around media arts and design but there were still some holes in the local conversation. So at Hyderabad Design Week, participatory art and multimedia amplifies this \\u2014 don\\u2019t look for mundane speaker sessions. Instead turn your heads to interactive installations such as ones by Loo Cafe and city-based studio DesignAware. \",\n",
      "    \"French city-based artist B\\u00e9atrice De Fays and French digital artist and musician Mathieu Constans have synced up to create VIA, an interactive installation fuelled by fine arts and the digital. \\u201cLife is composed by actions and reactions of human beings leaving their traces on the environment, spatial as well as temporal, which successively leaves its mark on these beings. This is the creative chain being offered through this creation,\\u201d B\\u00e9atrice explains in her usual poetic style of explanation. \",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"The artwork which is one aspect of the foundation here comprises layers. B\\u00e9atrice has painted different iconic landmarks such as Errum Manzil, Qutb Shahi Tombs and Charminar but some areas are graphically (and intentionally) glitchy with overlays of computer coding and patches of deep-hued texture. \",\n",
      "    \"When her partner Mathieu comes to Hyderabad, the design duo will be working for a few days on the development of the installation at Novotel Hitex, where she usually works. The core idea of the installation is for the participant \\u2014 not viewer \\u2014 to become more communicative with the self, the surroundings and others present in that space; it presents an interactive immersive environment generated in real-time by the visitors themselves.\",\n",
      "    \"Another dimension of immersion is sound design is part of the experiential centrepiece of the VIA installation. Mathieu, who creates digital and interactive devices which give visitors the chance to experience and experiment with the artistic creation itself, works at the juncture of conscience and sensibility. He finds sound is an essential component of his experimentation which also include graphic creations. \",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"The participants move through the process of transformation by immersing themselves in the space where the interactive installation is placed. The image, position and movements of the bodies of the participants are recorded in real time and in this way, their physical presence generates and activates a multimedia work that is constantly developing. Instead of seeing the quotidian and mundane surroundings we are used to, the elements of heritage and technology propel a time travel of sorts. Essentially, every participant has a different experience, says B\\u00e9atrice and she adds that she hopes people will take something a bit more introspective away from the exhibit. \",\n",
      "    \"The design community of the city is pretty familiar with the works of Deepak John Mathew, who has been dazzling many with his projects through his career as IIT Hyderabad\\u2019s Department of Design\\u2019s head. \",\n",
      "    \"But Hyderabad Design Week will have a double-whammy from Deepak: a Virtual Reality experience of the Qutb Shahi Tombs and a Virtual Reality 360-degree animation which recants the journey of Hayat Bakshi Begum. \",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"The Virtual Reality experience is a literal walk through history, the planes around the seven tombs brought to life by emerging technology. Sound design plays an integral role in the walkthrough. \\u201cThrough a unique interaction of heritage, design, and technology, the public will experience the lavish grandeur of the past amid the dynamic evolution of Hyderabad\\u2019s present via a cutting-edge Virtual Reality experience that enables viewers to visualise the Qutb Shahi tombs in the glory days of the Nizams,\\u201d says Deepak.\",\n",

Bringing together the latest in film technology with the rich narrative of Hyderabad's history, this installation will display the trailer of Ma Saheba- the Queen of Hyderabad,\\u201d he explains.\",\n",

      "    \"A new podcast is taking off. Now one-episode old, GayBCD co-hosted by Farhad Karkaria and Sunetro Lahiri, airs every Tuesday and hopes to be \\u201cthe dictionary of all things in life from a queer perspective.\\u201d Lahiri, 32 and Karkaria, 34 are creatives based in Mumbai. The latter also co-hosts another podcast on LGBTQ issues, called Keeping it Queer, with comedian Navin Noronha.\",\n",
      "    \"The pilot episode, which premiered last week, is an hour-long freewheeling conversation between Karkaria and Lahiri, weaving in and out of their personal memories. Their lazy tone and banter might just end up working for what the duo is trying to achieve: to highlight everyday things concerning queer people as issues that aren\\u2019t limited to being queer, but to merely \\u201cbeing human\\u201d. For example, their first episode, titled \\u2018Coming Out\\u2019, has Lahiri and Karkaria recalling how they told their respective sets of parents that they were not heterosexuals. \",\n",
      "    \"Ahead of their second episode, which will be available to stream today, the duo spoke about the podcast, their approach, and what GayBCD hopes to achieve.\",\n",

      "    \"Lahiri: Kavita [Rajwade, co-founder] of IVM Podcasts approached both of us separately. The idea was that the normalisation of queer life needs attention. This is how the conversation about the podcast evolved to us saying we will just talk about various aspects of life. This will be an unravelling of all things queer \\u2014 so people can say that this is not a queer dictionary, it\\u2019s a human dictionary.\",\n",
      "    \"Lahiri: As the conversation takes an organic shape, these episodes also became like therapy sessions for us.There\\u2019s so much unravelling happening, so many epiphanies. We also like being surprised by each others\\u2019 responses.\",\n",
      "    \"Karkaria: And a lot of times, it becomes therapeutic because we end up revisiting things that we don\\u2019t think about any more.\",\n",
      "    \"Karkaria: For instance, after the first episode, someone sent us a message about how he broke down after he heard the episode, and that led to a tender moment between him and his parents. He said that while he didn\\u2019t come out to his parents, it was good for him to know that they were there for him. I don\\u2019t have the aptitude to be an activist, but as long as it resonates with someone and gives some degree of comfort...[that\\u2019s a start].\",\n",
      "    \"Karkaria: We\\u2019ve recorded a few already. Dating is one. For us, it\\u2019s never been about just boys, boys, boy. Both Sunetro and I have had fulfilling, straight relationships in the past. \",\n",

      "    \"\\n26/09/2019, New Delhi: At the global technology brand OnePlus\\u2019 launch of their flagship device, OnePlus 7T. The same event also saw the launch of their first smart TV\\u2014 the OnePlus TV, a device that aims to seamlessly connect mobile and home networks for the future of interconnectivity\\n\\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \\nV V Krishnan  \",\n",
      "    \"At the bright-red illuminated interiors of Indira Gandhi Arena (stadium) in Delhi, OnePlus made it amply clear at their September 26 keynote that they\\u2019ve zeroed in on their target demographic and what they really want: entertainment and gaming.\",\n",
      "    \"Zake Zhang, product manager of the smartphone brand, shared worldwide stats of 2,000 vlogs on YouTube every hour, and 400,000,000 watching online video every month. He said OnePlus has made its cameras incredibly stable and easy to use on-the-go. The team also announced that the 90Hz fluid display \\u2014 which makes their phones \\u201csilly fast\\u201d as someone recently put it \\u2014 returns to the OnePlus 7T, making the company\\u2019s inclination towards gaming even more obvious and natural.\",\n",
      "    \"When co-founder Carl Pei closed the keynote, he told the audience \\u2014 who\\u2019d paid a pretty penny to be there that night \\u2014 that what they paid will be compensated on tickets to their Katy Perry and Dua Lipa concert in Mumbai this November. Loud cheers went up at all these junctures.\",\n",
      "    \"For a lot of premium smartphone users, the OnePlus 7T\\u2019s features might not have seemed as revolutionary as they were made to sound that night. Nor would the OnePlus TV and remote have impressed them. But making entertainment-friendly features available at just \\u20b939,999, (the phone) and starting \\u20b969,900 (the TV) spoke volumes of OnePlus\\u2019 commitment to those in their late-teens till anyone in their early 40s.\",\n",
      "    \"In an interview ahead of the launch, Vikas Agarwal, general manager of OnePlus India, spoke at length about doing a major launch in India, their sustained focus on this demographic, and the company\\u2019s bigger plans with the launch of the OnePlus TV. \",\n",
      "    \"Edited excerpts:\",\n",
      "    \"While over 70% of our business comes from global regions, India has been our biggest success. And the launch is our big commitment to the Indian market. The OnePlus TV too is primarily designed and produced for the Indian market. We have timed to launch it before the festival season [in the country], so the latest product is in the market, instead of people having to buy from other inventory clearance sales. As for smartphones, today, OnePlus has a 43% share in the premium segment [devices of \\u20b930,000+]. This is more than the combined share of the next two brands \\u2014 Apple and Samsung \\u2014 in India. And this has been just from online presence. But offline, have less than 10% share. [While] we already have 14 stores live, by the end of this year we\\u2019re looking at 35 stores, and by the end of next year, 100 stores across top 50 cities. Creating an offline touchpoint has become more relevant because we have TV too, now. If it works here, we take it globally.\",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"India has been our pilot market for a lot of initiatives in the past too: our global customer service operations are centred in India; we have our biggest global R&D centre \\u2014 just launched in Hyderabad last month \\u2014 and we\\u2019ve further committed \\u20b91,000 crores for developing this facility. So far, not many brands have focussed their R&D efforts in India. One Plus has also been manufacturing all its devices in India since 2015. This year, we are also looking at exporting from here.\",\n",
      "    \"We\\u2019ve always had challenges in managing our inventory. With every launch, our products have always sold out. We\\u2019ve been conservative, and demand has outgrown the supply we were able to build. Today, we are relatively better, but still have lots to learn. As a company, we are not used to this growth. In the first year, we sold a million units globally. And now, we sell a million units in India itself. We have reached a very different scale. In the smartphone industry, most brands die because of inventory, not because of lack of inventory. That\\u2019s something we are conscious of, and never want to take excessive risk that can question our survival.\",\n",
      "    \"Shenzhen is really the hardware hub of China. It is a lot easier for me to experiment with fifty designs there than anywhere else, and get a prototype in the shortest possible time. That helps us optimise in iterations, adding value to our design capabilities.\",\n",
      "    \"First, at OnePlus, we look at a device usability of three to four years. Even today, a lot of the devices we sold in 2015 are still active \\u2014 perhaps passed on to others in the family, or resold. We keep track of all these active devices. Therefore, fundamentally, there is much less e-waste for our devices, compared to the industry. We also have our own network of 65 exclusive stores, which have a recycle programme. And now, our new buyback programme will help us reduce e-waste and create loyalty around us.\",\n",
      "    \"Our TV\\u2019s future is going to be as a \\u2018smart hub\\u2019. The way we see it is you will need a master device to manage all of your smart devices. The smart TV is possibly the best positioned device for this, because it has a display, it is right in the centre of your house, and you can interact with the TV in multiple ways. We are looking at the smart-home as the broader, key theme, and at the centre of that will be the smart TV.\",\n",
      "    \"In the long term, there will be fewer dominant consumer behaviours, and brands will converge to [cater to] those. We are looking at a smart home OnePlus ecosystem of devices, but focussing on lifestyle and entertainment as key.\",\n",

      "    \"Despite being in a niche, Dark Souls is an action adventure role-playing series that is a blockbuster in its own right, carving out a new sub-genre known as Souls-like, which is defined by brutal difficulty and nail-biting action. Code Vein is the latest game in that same vein (pun intended) with a different take on this realm.\",\n",
      "    \"The first thing you\\u2019ll notice about Code Vein is the heavy Anime influences, courtesy the gorgeous character creator \\u2014 so intricate, you can recreate and portray your favourite hero. It may seem a bit odd if you have played a Souls game, but once you get past the contrast of the cartoonish against the realistic, Code Vein will not disappoint.\",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"The world itself is fascinating, taking place in the aftermath of a mysterious devastation. Humanity is reduced to revenants \\u2014 vampires that scour for both blood and sanity, pushing this rag-tag group further to find a way out of this cursed land where their bloodlust can drive them to become the Lost.\",\n",
      "    \"A Souls game in movement Code Vein is more like Bloodborne in combat allowing you to use a variety of outrageously large weapons from three classes (Fighter, Caster and Ranger) with unlockable gifts to give you an edge. The best part? You can switch out your classes any time.\",\n",
      "    \"The setting and monsters are dark and terrifying and the game does reward risk. To even things out, it introduces a meter that builds up as you successfully evade, letting you unleash a powerful attack; beware though, enemies have it too. In a radical departure from Souls-like games, Code Vein allows you to partner up with someone to go co-op.\",\n",
      "    \"If you love the Souls genre, Code Vein offers you a slightly different take on it \\u2014 with its refreshing Anime-inspired graphics and bold and bloody narrative, it is a solid game.\",\n",
      "    \"Studio Ghibli has ignited our imaginations with some of the best Anime movies, like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. It was good news all around when they partnered up with legendary game studio Level-5 for a new Ghibli adventure, you can play through. Ni No Kuni was released on the PlayStation 3 and instantly became a bestseller in 2013, and now the game is back on this generation of consoles.\",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"You play a boy named Oliver, who after the loss of his mother, is transported to another world by a fairy. Where it is revealed that both worlds are connected by soulmates and he has the chance to save his mother in his world, by hopefully saving her soulmate. Ni No Kuni, despite its cheery upbeat graphics, tells a surprisingly mature story, that hits the right notes as you journey through this mysterious realm.\",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"Very much like Pok\\u00e9mon, you roam through this secret realm and collect \\u2018Familiars\\u2019 as you go along. These little creatures aid you in battle as you control them as well as your companions on a battlefield you can freely roam. Again, don\\u2019t let the graphics fool you, as the game can be surprisingly challenging to the point of frustrating, so it\\u2019s best played in the easy mode setting.\",\n",
      "    \"While the game sticks to its Japanese RPG roots, with a linear story and quests to indulge yourself, it does let you roam about freely, letting you take in the sights. Which is undoubtedly beautiful, especially on the PS4 or Xbox One. Though where the game shines is on the go on your Nintendo Switch, though that version is not the remastered, but the PS3 version, which holds up very well on the Switch display.\",\n",
      "    \"Ni No Kuni is the perfect way to experience a classic, especially if you\\u2019re a Ghibli fan and want a perfect JRPG to keep you busy on those commutes.\",\n",

      "    \"The feeling of sitting in an aircraft (even an aircraft simulator) is overwhelming in the best way; a glance over the numerous controls, your peripheral vision being open skies, and a feeling of power that signs, seals and delivers the whole experience. The closest second, though, is offered through the mobile game, Indian Air Force: A Cut Above. In the game, you fly the Hawk, Mi-17, C-17, Apache, Mirage 2000, Su-30 and the headline-making Rafale aircraft. Just like 2014\\u2019s Guardians of the Skies from IAF, this game is built by Threye Interactive, a Delhi-based game development studio.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cWe invested in mobile games to reach the Indian youth through a platform preferred by them,\\u201d says Group Captain Anupam Banerjee, IAF spokesperson. Both games have been downloaded over a million times on the Google Play Store. On the first day, A Cut Above was downloaded over 50,000 times. He adds, \\u201cThe primary aim of this game is to get youth attracted to the profession of military aviation, while providing information about career options in the Indian Air Force.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"Five years ago, little did Anurag Rana, CEO of Threye, and his team know they would make video games for mobiles. Their first stint with animation was a short film titled Rockets Away (published on YouTube, May 2013). It tells the story of the IAF Mi-17 helicopters\\u2019 attack on Tololing Hill during the Kargil War of 1999. Owing to its success, they decided to develop Operation Morning Glory, a five-level PC game. Taking fans\\u2019 requests seriously, they listed it on the Google Play Store as well. As of now, the nine-megabyte game has over 1,00,000 downloads. So when they saw the IAF\\u2019s open call for mobile game developers, Anurag and his team knew they were in for business.\",\n",
      "    \"As per their blog \\u2018How the Indian Air Force got its game\\u2019 from June 2017, they faced competition from 120 developers, including Disney-UTV and Reliance. In December 2014, Guardians of the Skies was released by Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, at the IAF Auditorium, Subroto Park, New Delhi.\",\n",
      "    \"After you launch A Cut Above, the first thing you will see is the silver IAF emblem, followed by a brief loading screen before the home screen loads. Here, you will see an anonymous officer with Abhinandan on the name-tag. There are three game modes to choose from \\u2014 training, single-player and free flight. In the last one, for some reason, you have to register with your email address to play.\",\n",
      "    \"Go for this if you want to try out the different IAF aircraft without completing the tutorial. Register, and you will see a persona of a pilot with a gun-slinger moustache. Thus, officially give a shout-out to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, recipient of the Vir Chakra gallantry award in 2019.\",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"The single-player has 10 distinct missions, such as a surgical strike, air-to-air refuelling and base defence. This mode is unlocked only after completing the training with all nine stars. You can\\u2019t blame the Indian armed forces for being a stickler for perfection, can you?\",\n",
      "    \"Indeed, there is a learning curve for the first-time player, but the clunky controls make that challenging. Nikhil Abhishek, a Visakhapatnam-based gamer, feels the controls are fine as along you have to just fly. This changes quickly when you have to shoot at specific targets or land on the runway. \\u201cYou have to wait until you\\u2019re close to the target to actually see it. Then you only have a second or two to take your shot. The poor controls are your enemy here, not the targets,\\u201d he says jokingly.\",\n",
      "    \"Games like PUBG have made high-end graphics on a mobile the norm. That said, aesthetically, A Cut Above doesn\\u2019t turn heads. Anupam says \\u201cFurther development will be decided after analysing response from the users.\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \"The success of video games like Age Of Empires, Civilization and Assassin\\u2019s Creed has shown there is a market for the history genre. Considering the fact that the primary target audience of A Cut Above is teenagers and college students, it seems like a missed opportunity to mix education with fun. Perhaps the further developments Anupam referred to can include trivia about the IAF or a sneak peek into life in blue. The only source of information is the \\u2018career navigator\\u2019 button on the home screen of the game which links to IAF\\u2019s recruitment website.\",\n",
      "    \"Chandigarh-based Mukul Verma, who aspires to join the armed forces, says, \\u201cI like the game but it is not designed in a way to create curiosity among people who aren\\u2019t particularly keen to join the forces. I know about the game because I am interested in joining the forces.\\u201d A multi-player mode of A Cut Above is expected to release this month.\",\n",

There will be no way to tell if it\\u2019s real or not, so we have to take a different approach.\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \"In an interesting coincidence, a few days after Li\\u2019s ominous proclamation, Google released an open-source dataset, containing 3,000 original manipulated videos, to aid researchers develop deepfake detection systems.

      "    \"The technique used in Furious 7 is only similar and not the same as deepfake, which has been used to reach many malignant ends, like fake news proliferation and fake celebrity pornography.

      "    \"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has unveiled the latest iteration of his space company's newly assembled Starship, outlining a speedy development timeline for the centerpiece vehicle of SpaceXs quest to launch humans to the moon and Mars.\",\n",
      "    \"Mr. Musk showed a crowd of space enthusiasts and reporters at SpaceX\\u2019s rocket development site late on Saturday in the remote village of Boca Chica, Texas, animations of Starship landing on the moon and Mars and predicted that the rocket's first orbital flight could come in the next six months, followed by missions to space with humans aboard the next year.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThis is basically the holy grail of space,\\u201d Mr. Musk said, standing between a towering, newly assembled Starship rocket and Falcon 1 the company's first vehicle whose debut orbital mission was celebrated by SpaceX 11 years ago.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThe critical breakthrough that\\u2019s needed for us to become a space-faring civilization is to make space travel like air travel,\\u201d said Mr. Musk, who is also the chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla Inc.\",\n",
      "    \"Starship, a shiny steel rocketship designed to ferry dozens of humans to the moon and Mars, is the top half of Mr. Musk\\u2019s colossal interplanetary rocket system that stands 387-feet tall (118 metres) as the latest addition to SpaceXs lineup of reusable launch vehicles. Mr. Musk named Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as Starships first private passenger in 2018.\",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"The Boca Chica village, a few miles north of the Mexican border, is ground zero for SpaceX\\u2019s three-year experimental test programme for Starship, whose rocket engine tests have rattled the nerves of residents living in a remote hamlet of roughly two dozen homes a mile away.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cI think the actual danger to the Boca Chica village is low but it's not tiny,\\u201d Mr. Musk said during a question and answer session. \\u201cSo probably over time it had be better to buy out the villages, and we have made an offer to that effect.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"Some residents have rejected SpaceX\\u2019s non-negotiable offer to buyout their homes for three times the market value.\",\n",
      "    \"A three-legged prototype of the rocket named Starhopper has test launched in the village twice since July, most recently flying as high as 500 feet (152 metres) and landing on an adjacent slab of concrete to trial Mr. Musk\\u2019s next generation rocket engine dubbed Raptor.\",\n",
      "    \"Mr. Musk\\u2019s mission to the moon aligns with NASA\\u2019s goal of sending humans there by 2024 under its Artemis programme, an accelerated deep-space initiative spurred by the Trump administration in March that aims to work with a handful of U.S. space companies in building a long-term presence on the lunar surface before eventually colonizing Mars.\",\n",
      "    \"The space agency has tapped SpaceX to figure out how to land vehicles on the lunar surface and help develop a system for refueling rockets like Starship in space, an important technology to aid sustained exploration efforts on the Moon and Mars, NASA said in a release on Friday.\",\n",
      "    \"NASA has awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co. a total of $6.8 billion to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil for the first time since 2011. Development of both astronaut capsules have been beset by delays and testing mishaps.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cI am looking forward to the SpaceX announcement tomorrow. In the meantime, Commercial Crew is years behind schedule,\\u201d NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a September 27 night statement. \\u201cNASA expects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer.

      "    \"A recent paper titled \\u2018Drones: A new frontier for Police\\u2019 published in the Indian Police Journal (IPJ) by IPS officer and Additional Director General in Rajasthan Police, Pankaj Kumar Singh, has talked about these new techniques.\",\n",

This Australia designed weapon has an effective range of 2 kms, the paper said. \",\n",
      "    \"Another solution to block a lethal drone is the sky fence system that uses a range of signal disruptors to jam the flight path and prevent them from entering their target, a sensitive installation or event venue, it said. \",\n",
      "    \"Officials said prototypes of these counter-drone weapons were displayed for the first time at an open field in a BSF camp in Bhondsi, Haryana last week as part of a national conference organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) on anti-drone technology. \",\n",

      "    \"The story so far: Tech websites and theoretical computer-science outlets were aflame earlier this week after a story in the U.K.-based Financial Times said Google had claimed to have achieved \\u2018quantum supremacy\\u2019. In a line, it means that researchers at Google had solved a really difficult problem in seconds with the help of quantum computers which a supercomputer could not. The research paper is yet to be formally vetted by peers in the field and became public after having appeared briefly on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website \\u2014 apparently some of its researchers were involved in the project. It is likely to reappear soon in a complete form.\",\n",
      "    \"Quantum computers work differently from the classical computers we work on today. Exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics, they can easily tackle computational problems that may be tough for the classical computer as the size of the numbers and number of inputs involved grows bigger. Quantum computers do not look like desktops or laptops that we associate the word \\u2018computer\\u2019 with. Instead (and there are only a handful of them) they resemble the air-conditioned server rooms of many offices or the stacks of central processing units from desktops of yore that are connected by ungainly tangled wires and heaped in freezing rooms. Conventional computers process information in \\u2018bits\\u2019 or 1s and 0s, following classical physics under which our computers can process a \\u20181\\u2019 or a \\u20180\\u2019 at a time. The world\\u2019s most powerful super computer today can juggle 148,000 trillion operations in a second and requires about 9000 IBM CPUs connected in a particular combination to achieve this feat. Quantum computers compute in \\u2018qubits\\u2019 (or quantum bits). They exploit the properties of quantum mechanics, the science that governs how matter behaves on the atomic scale. In this scheme of things, processors can be a 1 and a 0 simultaneously, a state called quantum superposition. While this accelerates the speed of computation, a machine with less than a 100 qubits can solve problems with a lot of data that are even theoretically beyond the capabilities of the most powerful supercomputers. Because of quantum superposition, a quantum computer \\u2014 if it works to plan \\u2014 can mimic several classical computers working in parallel. The ideas governing quantum computers have been around since the 1990s but actual machines have been around since 2011, most notably built by Canadian company D-Wave Systems.\",\n",
      "    \"The speed and capability of classical supercomputers are limited by energy requirements. Along with these they also need more physical space. Looking for really useful information by processing huge amounts of data quickly is a real-world problem and one that can be tackled faster by quantum computers. For example, if we have a database of a million social media profiles and had to look for a particular individual, a classical computer would have to scan each one of those profiles which would amount to a million steps. In 1996, Lov K. Grover from Bell Labs discovered that a quantum computer would be able to do the same task with one thousand steps instead of a million. That translates into reduced processors and reduced energy.\",\n",
      "    \" \",\n",
      "    \"\\nWhat quantum computing means for your bank accounts and smartphones\\n\",\n",
      "    \"In theory, a quantum computer can solve this problem rapidly because it can attack complex problems that are beyond the scope of a classical computer. The basic advantage is speed as it is able to simulate several classical computers working in parallel. Several encryption systems used in banking and security applications are premised on computers being unable to handle mathematical problems that are computationally demanding beyond a limit. Quantum computers, in theory, can surpass those limits.\",\n",
      "    \"Quantum supremacy refers to quantum computers being able to solve a problem that a classical computer cannot. In the research paper, Google used a 53-qubit processor to generate a sequence of millions of numbers. Though these numbers appeared randomly generated, they conform to an algorithm generated by Google. A classical supercomputer checked some of these values and they were correct. Google\\u2019s quantum computer, named Sycamore, claimed \\u2018supremacy\\u2019 because it reportedly did the task in 200 seconds that would have apparently taken a supercomputer 10,000 years to complete.\",\n",
      "    \"Impressive as this may sound, experts caution that this does not imply that the quantum computer can solve every challenging problem thrown at it. The number-generating task was the equivalent of having a Ferrari and a truck compete in a race and, on the car\\u2019s predictable victory, declare that the Ferrari could do everything that a truck did. While IBM and a few other private establishments also have quantum computer prototypes, a common ailment is that they have their own unique propensity to errors and are not as amenable to executing real world problems as super computers.\",\n",
      "    \"Then again, nothing yet rules out the creation of new mathematical methods or techniques that would allow classical computers to execute the same task faster. Some experts even question the term \\u2018quantum supremacy\\u2019 coined by theoretical physicist John Preskill of the California Institute of Technology, United States. However, the Google feat shows that quantum computers are capable of a real world task. It gives confidence to private entrepreneurs and even academics to invest time and money to improving them and customise them to real world problems. In terms of the number of qubits, D-Wave Systems says it is ready to commercially launch a 5000-qubit system by 2020. It already has a 1000-qubit system at NASA. D-Wave claims that car maker Volkswagen used its quantum computers to figure out how best to control a fleet of taxis in Beijing relying on data from 10,000 cars, but the research paper describing this experiment does not quite explain how the proposed solution is better than algorithms that are currently used to optimise traffic flow.\",\n",
      "    \"A question critics raise is how the use of quantum computing and its ability to break encryption codes will impact online banking. Breaking banking grade encryption is far away. Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist who has written on Google\\u2019s feat, opines that current encryption standards would require a quantum computer to have \\u201cseveral thousand logical qubits\\u201d working in tandem perfectly. It requires millions of qubits of the kind that powers Sycamore to make \\u2018logical qubits\\u2019 and the 53 at Sycamore\\u2019s disposal does not quite cut the ice. However, there are other approaches to designing quantum computers and with it there may be cleverer ways to solve problems using them. Moreover, if technological breakthroughs were to pose a real threat to banking or financial operations, it is likely that banks will harness quantum computers themselves.\",\n",
      "    \"There are no quantum computers in India yet. In 2018, the Department of Science & Technology unveiled a programme called Quantum-Enabled Science & Technology (QuEST) and committed to investing \\u20b980 crore over the next three years to accelerate research. The ostensible plan is to have a quantum computer built in India within the next decade. Phase-1 of the problem involves hiring research experts and establishing teams with the know-how to physically build such systems.\",\n",

      "    \"WorldSkills is an organisation that has built a movement, and is changing the lives of young people by promoting different skills. Every two years, it organises world championships of vocational skills, which is held in different parts of the world. It brings together youngsters, industries, governments, and educational institutions, to promote the benefits of and need for skilled trade professionals.\",\n",
      "    \"This year, the competition was held in Kazan, Russia, wherein more than 1,500 competitors from 60 countries competed in 55 skill competitions at this mega event. This year, India participated in 44 skills including mobile robotics, prototype modelling, hairdressing, baking, confectionery and patisserie, car painting and floristry, among others. \",\n",
      "    \"Start of the journey\",\n",
      "    \"Among the 48 participants who represented India, Shubham Singh bagged the \\u2018Medal of Excellence in Cyber Security\\u2019. Shubham is pursuing his final year of Bachelor\\u2019s of Computer Applications (BCA) from Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab. He first got to know about the India Skills competition (the first level of WordSkills) through a friend. The first phase of the competition was held in September 2018, which was an online test of different challenges consisting of topics such as web testing, forensics, malware analysis, reverse engineering and so on.\",\n",
      "    \"After scoring third place in this round, he headed to Delhi for the finals in which he was awarded first place. Shubham was then invited by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) India to participate in the WorldSkills International Competition, where he took part in cyber security skills competition along with Swapnil, his teammate from Delhi.\",\n",
      "    \"To prepare for the competition, he had to first polish his skills in areas such as cryptography and encryption, which he was able to do with the help of his professor, Gurupreet Kaur, who guided him whenever he faced any challenges, especially in cryptography. Afterwards, Shubham and Swapnil both trained with Infosys for a month which enhanced their skillsets. In August 2019, they both went to Kazan, Russia, along with the other participants. The main part of the WordSkills competition was held over four days in which the participants were given specific tasks and challenges. They were evaluated and scored by experts in the field on their ability to \\u2018attack\\u2019 the opposing system, as well as defend their own system from being \\u2018attacked\\u2019.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cInitially, I did not know that the competition would be this big,\\u201d says Shubham. \\u201cHowever, this competition helped me in more ways than I expected and I was able to learn a lot from it.\\u201d He goes on to say how his professors were a big support during the entire process of the competition, from helping in clearing doubts to helping him catch up in the classes he had to miss during the training period.\",\n",
      "    \"Future funding\",\n",
      "    \" Talking more about his experience at Kazan, Shubham adds, \\u201cI interacted with many participants from various skill backgrounds, as well as from those in my own skills set from other countries. There was a lot for me to take away from this opportunity and this experience will help me in the future.\\u201d Shubham will be felicitated by the Government of India and National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), later this month.\",\n",

      "    \"The hype around iOS 13 (which rolled out worldwide on September 19) was largely around Dark Mode, the keyboard\\u2019s Quickpath, the adorable Memoji feature and, for the geekier folks out there, the ARKit 3. But the true potential of iOS 13 is best harnessed by the iPhone 11 series, a clever if not cunning move by tech giant Apple. \",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"At 188 grams the iPhone 11 Pro is slightly lighter than the iPhone XR\\u2019s 194 grams, with the newer model looking much sleeker and compact than the XR. \",\n",
      "    \"Right off the bat, the speed of iPhone 11 Pro is mesmerically fluid, the new A13 Bionic chipset making its mark. As this is a first impression, the official later review will determine how truly effective it is. A13\\u2019s Third Generation Neural is a major result of Apple\\u2019s machine learning developments; it understands your usage patters quickly and helps you ultimately save battery power, answering the long-pervasive problem of Apple\\u2019s less-than-lacklustre battery power. \",\n",
      "    \"For some clarity, the day started with a 94% battery and (given my Screen Time feature showed a 7-hour and 43-minute usage), I was pleasantly surprised at the 57% battery by 10:30pm.\",\n",
      "    \"After a 45-minute gaming session of Capcom\\u2019s Shinsekai Into The Depths on Apple Arcade, the battery power didn\\u2019t take too much of a hit.

      "    \"The 5.8-inch Super Retina XDR Display on the iPhone 11 Pro is a stunner; if you switch devices, you\\u2019ll notice the difference right away.

      "    \"A better display means a better camera experience. The iPhone 11 series has upgraded for sure, pegging the much-memed cameras on the back as a unified triple-camera system with all-new Ultra Wide, Wide and Telephoto cameras.

      "    \"Twinkle Khanna is flustered. One of her children is competing for her attention as she fields questions about her latest venture. In a moment reminiscent of the many droll anecdotes that light up her d\\u00e9but book, Mrs Funnybones, the child is triumphant and drags her away. Khanna excuses herself apologetically: \\u201cIt is Saturday. Everyone is home.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"We\\u2019re discussing Tweak, the women-centric digital media platform launching on September 30. It promises to be \\u201ca space for the modern Indian woman to challenge old ideas and discover new ones and offer readers solutions that offer maximum results with minimum effort\\u201d. Khanna says that the idea found its roots in the many women who approached her after her columns became popular. \\u201cI realised that even though these women often had starkly different backgrounds, they had similar problems.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"The easiest way out, she admits, would have been to start an Oprah-style TV show. However, that would have clashed with her penchant for avoiding the spotlight. \\u201cI can\\u2019t be bothered to continually fix my eyelashes and make-up. I\\u2019d rather go to work in my pyjamas.\\u201d Her work apparel of choice led to a rather more ambitious denouement. Tweak will have contributions from experts in various fields, eminent writers and celebrities. These range from parenting (with an emphasis on topics like bullying, LGBTQ+ sensitisation, gender equality) to wellness (with a holistic approach to fitness, positive body image and mental health awareness). \",\n",
      "    \"\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"While the platform is not yet live, the publicity material suggests Tweak will also provide a deep-dive into culture, with a focus on sustainability, beauty, career and lifestyle. \\u201cWe wanted to make the aspirational a little more acceptable,\\u2019\\u2019 says Khanna. \\u201cNot that it means we\\u2019ll push a $4,000 Dolce & Gabanna bag, nor will we nudge you towards Big Bazaar. We\\u2019ll help you find a trendy sweet spot.\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \"Doesn\\u2019t this sound uncannily like the Refinery29 of India? Khanna says the team looked at the most popular platforms in India and abroad (which includes the aforementioned Refinery29, apart from Goop and POPxo) and found that there was an opportunity to learn from the best and turn it into something unique. What\\u2019s special about the platform, according to her, is that it is agnostic to demographics. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not running after just the youth. We also want to hear from older folks. Nobody seems to want to hear from them, but their experience matters. They have so much more to share.\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \" In times when the explosion of content is almost anxiety-inducing, and platforms are constantly competing for eyeballs, Khanna says the quality and range of content are key to set themselves apart. \\u201cWe have something for everyone: short and long reads, podcasts, videos and events. And we aren\\u2019t giving sermons or telling people how to live. We\\u2019ve kept our tone irreverent and funny. I think that\\u2019s why people read me, and I hope that works for the platform as well,\\u201d she says. \",\n",
      "    \"The team running Tweak is small but feisty. While the initial plan was put together by Khanna and Vikram Raizada, they eventually recruited Rochelle Pinto, a former digital editor at Elle and GQ, to be editor. \\u201cWe planned to have very skilled writers as freelancers supported by our in-house writers doing simpler pieces. Ultimately, it turned out to be the exact opposite. Our in-house team of 11 is brilliant,\\u201d says Khanna. \",\n",
      "    \"Have they figured out how to make money off a content platform? Khanna says it would be foolish to enter a business without a plan. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve identified five revenue sources \\u2014 but I can\\u2019t tell you what they are. We don\\u2019t want others to benefit from our hard work! Hopefully our projections will hold up.\\u201d She also emphasises that technology plays a critical role in ensuring the success of such platforms as well, right from the back-end that manages content, to the servers that handle it. \",\n",
      "    \"As for the overall approach, Khanna says it is three-pronged: in-house opinion, contributions from freelancers, and articles by experts in various fields. She herself will contribute long-form pieces and conduct interviews with experts and celebrities. \\u201cTrust me, interviewing is much more challenging than being the interviewee,\\u201d she laughs.\",\n",
      "    \"Given the celebrities who have recently taken to social media to promote Tweak, I ask if there\\u2019s another writer from the fraternity who is ready to surprise us with their pen. \\u201cA lot of people started writing at the same time as I did. I don\\u2019t know how they fared and whether they were passionate enough about writing,\\u201d she says. \",\n",
      "    \"For her, however, the last seven years have been transformative. Writing is now an inseparable part of her. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know a different way of living. I didn\\u2019t have any acting skills, so thank God I could write!\\u201d There is a thoughtful pause. \\u201c... But I don\\u2019t want Tweak to be about me,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a collaborative platform. I\\u2019d like it to stay that way.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"Just as we\\u2019re winding up, another (or perhaps the same) recalcitrant child clamours for her attention once again. She returns to our conversation with a well-aimed dig: \\u201cThis is what women have to deal with, even when we\\u2019re doing interviews. Somehow, this doesn\\u2019t really happen to men.\\u201d\",\n",

      "    \"Why can\\u2019t we stop scrolling on Instagram? It is a question that our parents have been asking us. Now, with conversations about unplugging from social media and staying offline, the millennial and Gen Z folk are wondering the same. \\u201cYou\\u2019re absolutely normal,\\u201d Rega Jha assures us on a new YouTube show, Nerding Out. The short-format show is produced by Vitamin Stree, a women-centric content platform.\",\n",
      "    \"Jha, former editor-in-chief at Buzzfeed India, has hosted and written the first episode on the attention economy. \\u201cThe Internet has been an endless source of learning for me and I am so thankful to creators who make complex ideas accessible for the rest of us. This was my attempt at doing the same, breaking down something I think about a lot, which should be of urgent importance to all young people,\\u201d she says. The second episode is set to release on October 2.\",\n",
      "    \"The idea behind the show is simple, says Padmini Vaidyanathan, editor and creative head of Vitamin Stree. \\u201cWe wanted to talk about experiences and behaviours that are an integral part of life, but are also changing the way we are. Some of it is existential \\u2014 like how can I not be addicted to social media, when everything is happening there. Others are more cultural, like the beliefs we have grown up with which are not necessarily true,\\u201d she says.

      "    \"\\\"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol [10 to the power of 100, or 1 followed by 100 zeroes] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines,\\u201d they wrote in their paper.\",\n",
      "    \"Their mission statement, from the outset, was \\\"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\\\", and its unofficial slogan is \\\"Don't be evil\\\". \",\n",
      "    \"Google, operating today in over 100 languages, is considered one of the Big Four technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple and Facebook. Now, the verb \\\"google\\\" has been added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, meaning \\\"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\\\"\",\n",
      "    \"Google Doodles, too, have been part of the company since its inception. The very first Doodle was in honour of the Burning Man Festival of 1998. It was designed by Page and Brin themselves to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent ones were designed by an outside contractor, until the founders asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From then on, Doodles have been organised and created by a team of employees termed \\\"Doodlers\\\".\",\n",
      "    \"As of October 2016, Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries. Alexa, a commercial web traffic monitoring company, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger.\",\n",

      "    \"Former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, who has announced a new AI startup with USD50 million fund, believes India has the potential to become a world leader in artificial intelligence but the key to this is integrating AI into the country\\u2019s education system in a massive way.\",\n",
      "    \"India is at \\u201can inflection point\\u201d when it comes to AI or artificial intelligence, Mr. Sikka said.\",\n",
      "    \"Over the next 20-25 years, AI is going to be \\u201ca very, very big disruptor\\u201d for the Indian society because what one is seeing now in terms of automation and job losses is just the beginning, said Mr. Sikka, who announced his startup Vianai Systems last week.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cBut on the other hand, if we are able to bring AI education, the ability to build AI systems to India at a very large scale, and I\\u2019m talking about like billion plus people, then India can really leap frog and become the world\\u2019s leader in artificial intelligence, in AI skill and AI talent,\\u201d Mr. Sikka told PTI in an exclusive interview.\",\n",
      "    \"Doing that requires working on multiple dimensions in parallel, he said.\",\n",
      "    \"Last month, at the request of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Sikka gave a presentation before the NITI Aayog how to expand the reach of AI to the Indian society in a very big way.\",\n",
      "    \"Representatives of some 20 Union Ministries were present during his presentation on AI and India. This, he said, required creating necessary infrastructure to bring the talent through institutions, schools and educational institutions, the ability to do AI education at a large scale.\",\n",
      "    \"According to Mr. Sikka, the Prime Minister said he personally saw whenever classes worked into digital classrooms, he was joking that children would sometimes even forget to eat their lunch because they were so engrossed in learning. \\u201cIt was very encouraging. But I think a lot of that has to be done,\\u201d he said and suggested multi-faceted countrywide programme like digital classrooms.\",\n",
      "    \"If India does nothing then this great wave of AI is going to have massive disruption over the next 20 years. But on the other hand, if it puts together programmes then this can be a huge advantage for it and \\u201cwe can be a leader in the world,\\u201d he said.\",\n",
      "    \"Referring to his interactions with the Indian government officials and the steps being taken by Mr. Modi, Mr. Sikka said he is very encouraged by the commitment.\",\n",
      "    \"His Vianai Systems is an AI Enterprise Platform startup with a mission to help businesses around the world successfully leverage AI to drive fundamental digital transformations.\",\n",
      "    \"He said there have been remarkable achievements in the field of AI, but conceded that significant issues too have emerged in the field of artificial intelligence.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThe technique themselves are quite opaque, not transparent. The lack of ability to explain is one of the major weaknesses of these techniques,\\u201d Mr. Sikka said.\",\n",
      "    \"He said that there is an incredible shortage of talent in the field of AI.\",\n",
      "    \"With this in backdrop, Mr. Sikka said he started this venture to build a platform that can dramatically improve the accessibility of AI, that is educational, that explains to people how this works, that they can experiment with it, they can play with it, they can explore and understand what is happening.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThat is what my prototype was about,\\u201d said Mr. Sikka as he went back to his PhD thesis on AI in 90s.\",\n",
      "    \"For its mass application in a transparent manner, he said there is a need to build a platform that is a dramatic improvement on what is available today.\",\n",
      "    \"Mr. Sikka has raised USD50 million as the startup seed money.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cHopefully, we wouldn\\u2019t have to raise any money again,\\u201d he said, adding that the objective is to bring AI to businesses on massive scale. Last week, he demonstrated the first glimpse of the platform at the Oracle Open World event in the Silicon Valley.\",\n",
      "    \"One of the reasons that there are so few applications of engineer machine learning is because the techniques and the tools are extremely dense, they are complicated, the experience of developer is broken profound.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cSo we wanted to make it dramatically simpler to access an AI system and to execute on AI. His platform dramatically simplifies the AI system from thousands of lines of codes to a few dozens of lines of codes. This will make the systems much much simpler,\\u201d he said.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cWe have been thinking very carefully, and very diligently about how we can come up with a platform that is completely agnostic, completely open and yet makes it dramatically simpler, and more efficient and more exploratory to build an AI system. And with that when you think about a future where enterprises will deploy dozens, if not hundreds of AI applications, you need something like this to make that happen. And that\\u2019s what we are working on,\\u201d Mr. Sikka said.\",\n",
      "    \"Last week, he announced a panel of advisors from industry and academia for Vianai. They include Henning Kagermann, former chairman and CEO of SAP and chairman of Acatech; Alan Kay, Turing Award winner and computer science pioneer; Divesh Makan, founder of ICONIQ Capital; Indra Nooyi, member of the board at Amazon and Schlumberger and former CEO of PepsiCo; and Sebastian Thrun, CEO of Kitty Hawk Corporation and co-founder and chairman of Udacity.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cEvery company that hopes to be a leader in their industry needs to understand the transformative potential of AI, and to successfully activate it within their organisations,\\u201d said Nooyi in a statement.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThe market need is immense, and Vianai, with its capable leadership and differentiated platform, is in a unique position to address it. I look forward to being an advisor to the company in the exciting times ahead,\\u201d she said.\",\n",

      "    \"The OnePlus 7T has three cameras, much like its predecessor, but they\\u2019re arranged horizontally this time, inside a circular notch \\u2014 perhaps replicating the more natural experience of how we use our eyes. In an interview, the General Manager of OnePlus India Vikas Agarwal had earlier said that this new setting was a \\u201cbold move\\u201d aesthetically.\",\n",
      "    \"The three cameras are a 48MP primary, an 117-degree ultra wide camera and a 2x telephoto camera.\",\n",
      "    \"Noticing the sort of macro shots being populated under the #shotononeplus, One Plus decided to have macro motors that\\u2019d allow users to shoot from just 2.5 cm away from a subject.\",\n",
      "    \"There is now an independent motor drive for just the haptics, too, for a better gaming experience.\",\n",
      "    \"As for India centric features, OnePlus has announced a live cricket score widget on the minus one screens or shelves, improvements to their photo gallery to sort photos based on subject into smart albums (recognising faces, or actions and themes). All of this, they say, happens within the device itself and without internet connectivity \\u2014 thereby ensuring privacy and efficient processing.\",\n",
      "    \"To hoots and cheers, the company also announced a 5GB cloud storage should the user wish to upload photos, and an extra 50GB free storage for the first year for OnePlus 7T users.\",\n",
      "    \"While a lot of these features might sound familiar for other premium smartphone users, what was really neat was their Work-Life Balance mode. Now, apps that you typically use for work will be in the \\u2018Work\\u2019 mode of the phone, while apps you use for friends, family, and non-work-related engagements, will be in the \\u2018Life\\u2019 mode. While on one mode, notifications from apps native to the other mode, will be in a kind of DND.\",\n",
      "    \"They\\u2019ve even added intelligence to this, with the OnePlus 7T picking up a change in location, or wifi connection, to automatically switch between these modes for you.\",\n",
      "    \"The SMS sorting into spam and a \\u2018focussed\\u2019 folder of sorts (like on an Outlook email box or the more recent iOS rollouts) will prove to be a nifty feature, especially for the Indian context, where receiving advertorial spam is common.\",\n",

      "    \"The TV will have a 55inch screen, and will use QLED technology. It has 4K resolution, and uses the Gamma Color Magic processor. But what really stands out as a differentiator for the OnePlus TV is retractable, sliding sound bar. There are 6 speakers facing the front of the TV, and 2 facing the back. Together, they will produce a 50W sound output (in comparison to a 20-40W sound output for any other high end TV in the market).\",\n",
      "    \"The sliding motion of the sound bar comes with longevity for close to 100,000 motions \\u2014 and this sliding itself will be quieter than the quietest of air conditioners, says OnePlus, at 32 decibels only.\",\n",
      "    \"The OnePlus TV\\u2019s carbon-fiber reinforced back panel comes with a magnetic plate into which all ports are neatly hidden. At its thinnest, the TV is 7 mm, and has a 95.7 percent screen-to-body ratio. However, design-wise, the remote doesn\\u2019t seem entirely new \\u2014 no numbers, minimal buttons.\",\n",
      "    \"Use the TV to play music from your phone or and stream games as you\\u2019re playing them, via bluetooth. The OnePlus TV comes with the Android TV 9, and is compatible with Alexa. The controlling via smartphone that they did a live demo of during the launch, seemed very similar to the operationality of the Amazon Firestick (trackpad on your phone to navigate the TV screen, type on your phone keyboard, instead of searching for letters on the TV screen).\",\n",

She has two channels on the video platform: on the first, @TheOfficalGeet, she puts up motivational, self-care, and self-help videos; on the second, @EnglishWithGeet, she shares snippet-sized spoken English lessons. \\u201cHindi se English seekhne ke liye mere saath TikTok par judd jayiye,\\u201d is her consistent sign off. \",\n",
      "    \"Geet, who grew up in Seattle, wanted to be an actor. A childhood accident though, paralysed her waist-down. Her dependence on a wheelchair had kept her from breaking into the film industry. After being back-and-forth between India and the U.S., to work with children and at-risk youth here, in 2014 Geet participated on a Zee TV reality show, India\\u2019s Best Cinestars ki Khoj. She couldn\\u2019t make it past the dance rounds.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cWith that, the acting keeda had come back again,\\u201d she says. In August 2015, with her brother\\u2019s encouragement, she started her own Facebook Page. But not knowing what would work, she started with motivational videos. \",\n",
      "    \"She took this to TikTok in February last year, while also putting up comedy shorts that she made with her 87-year-old grandmother. \\u201cBut to my surprise, it was the motivational videos that did better; we had videos on socially relevant topics like domestic violence, saas bahu relationships, and confidence. I was getting thousands and views and comments even within the first few weeks,\\u201d recalls Geet.\",\n",
      "    \"Over time, noticing that her Hindi was weaker than her English, which she still speaks with an American accent, her audience started writing in with special request to clarify something. And so it began. She started with simple vocabulary (\\u201cgorgeous\\u201d instead of saying \\u201cvery pretty\\u201d) or correcting common mistakes (saying \\u201cladies\\u201d even for singular usage, instead of \\u201clady\\u201d).

      "    \" Wearing a fedora, Jang Myung-jin shouts \\u201cHello, comrades!\\u201d as he starts his YouTube broadcast, titled \\u201cA North Korean man, Tango.\\u201d Then, he talks about whether North Koreans raise pet dogs, what type of profanity they use and whether there are any transgender people in the country. \",\n",
      "    \"The 32-year-old Jang is among a handful of young North Korean refugees in South Korea who have launched YouTube channels that offer a rare glimpse into the everyday lives of people in North Korea, one of the world\\u2019s most secretive and repressive countries. \",\n",
      "    \"While mainstream outside media reports on North Korea focus on heavy subjects like the North\\u2019s nuclear program or its internal power hierarchy, these young YouTubers feed a growing demand for softer news related to daily life in their former home country. \",\n",
      "    \"Their rise comes amid increased public attention to North Korea, whose young leader, Kim Jong Un, has made global headlines with a provocative run of weapons tests and high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump. \",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThere are people who yearn for real scenes showing how people in North Korea live. There is a niche market for that,\\u201d said Jeon Young-sun, a research professor at Seoul\\u2019s Konkuk University. \\u201cSimply speaking, some people are curious about what beer North Koreans drink and what cookies they eat.\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \"Jang uses his Samsung smartphone to film himself at his small Seoul apartment, and sometimes invites fellow North Korean refugees as guests and has friends shoot him when he ventures out. He often appears with his trademark dark fedora, but sometimes with a colourful wig, a false mustache or even a Kim Jong Un mask. \",\n",
      "    \"Video clips uploaded on Jang\\u2019s 2-year-old channel showed him saying that ordinary North Koreans usually raise dogs, rabbits, pigs and chickens, but to either eat or sell to markets. He said that calling someone \\u201ca baby born by a young female slave\\u201d is considered a profanity in North Korea, and that people there say \\u201cDo you want to have the order of your ribs revolutionarily reorganised?\\u201d when trying to intimidate others. \",\n",
      "    \"Jang, who has about 7,000 subscribers to his channel, said he does manual labour and delivers fried chicken as a means of living because his YouTube-related income is too small. But he feels it\\u2019s worth it to keep his YouTube career going because some subscribers have left messages saying his broadcasts helped resolve their misunderstandings of North Korea. \",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThey cheer me up and make me be positive. They are the reasons why I shoot YouTube videos today and tomorrow,\\u201d Jang said, petting his Maltese. \",\n",
      "    \"Other North Korea-born YouTubers talk about why they left their homeland and the experiences they\\u2019ve had in South Korea. Some also broadcast themselves putting on North Korean-style makeup or eating foods from the country. \",\n",
      "    \"The young YouTubers are mostly stylish, contrary to the stereotype of North Korean refugees as being rough and unsophisticated. About 32,000 North Koreans have fled to the South over the past two decades to avoid poverty and political repression. \",\n",
      "    \"Kang Na-ra, a North Korean escapee who regularly appears on two YouTube channels and two TV programs, is called \\u201cPrincess Na-ra\\u201d by her fans. The 22-year-old with long, brown-dyed hair said she has a 200-member fan club that has sent her a cake topped with a mini-Kang doll on her birthday for the past three years. \",\n",
      "    \"When Kang, dressed in a North Korean military uniform, showed how to put on North Korean-style makeup on her YouTube channel, her subscribers wrote, \\u201cYou are so pretty even without makeup\\u201d and \\u201cYou\\u2019re such a beauty.\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cI like communicating with people by posting responses to the messages that they put on my channel,\\u201d said Kang, wearing two rings on each of her hands. \\u201cI want to let the people know about North Korean culture and show more about how I am living in South Korea.\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \"The YouTubers, however, also have anti-fans who often vent their anger at them when North Korea does something provocative like conduct a weapons test. \",\n",
      "    \"Kang said she feels a \\u201clittle sad\\u201d when she reads malicious messages from people such as \\u201cGo back to your country\\u201d and \\u201cWhy does a Red live here?\\u201d \",\n",
      "    \"Jang said some messages have been left for him wishing for him to be assassinated with a poisoned needle or banished to a North Korean coal mine. \",\n",

      "    \"While there have been some TV programs in the South featuring North Korean refugees, some experts say they don\\u2019t fully carry the escapees\\u2019 voices because they were directed, filmed and edited by South Koreans. \",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cOn YouTube, defectors can speak whatever they want without being filtered and edited. ... Given that, I would say their programs provide content that the TV shows can\\u2019t provide,\\u201d said Lee Kwang Baek, the South Korean head of a YouTube channel on North Korea. \",\n",
      "    \"Their YouTube programs are also believed to help address the widespread misinformation about North Korea in the South. Jang said a middle school student once asked him if North Koreans eat dirt when they\\u2019re hungry, while another escapee-turned-YouTuber, Lee Pyung, said he was asked whether North Koreans give potatoes instead of money to a driver when they take a bus. \",\n",
      "    \"The YouTubers\\u2019 most popular content is stories of their dangerous escapes to South Korea. \",\n",
      "    \"Kang\\u2019s escape story, posted on someone else\\u2019s YouTube channel last year, has received about 1.7 million views. She said she thought she was going to die when she was carried away by water while crossing the Tumen River to go to China before coming to South Korea in December 2014. \",\n",
      "    \"Kang said she ran away from her home in North Korea after fighting with her stepmother. Then her biological mother, who had already resettled in South Korea, hired brokers who helped her come to the South about two weeks later. \",\n",
      "    \"Besides her longing for her mother, Kang said her wishes to wear jeans, dye her hair and date handsome South Korean men also pushed her to make a perilous journey to the South. \",\n",
      "    \"Jang hasn\\u2019t posted his escape story yet because he said he wants to fill his channel with more amusing content. \",\n",
      "    \"Jang said he had a big crush on the 11-year-old girl with fair skin and big eyes, who lived with her grandmother. He recalled how the two would hold hands when he walked her to her house. \",\n",
      "    \"After the girl didn\\u2019t come to school for two to three weeks, their teacher asked Jang to go and check on her. When he arrived at her home, he found the girl, then all skin and bones, lying dead with her eyes and mouth open, while her grandmother had disappeared. \",\n",
      "    \"Terrified, Jang immediately bolted out of the house and reported the girl\\u2019s death to neighbors before crying all day. \",\n",
      "    \"A few months later, he fled North Korea with his parents and younger brother. \",\n",
      "    \"Before his family walked across the frozen Tumen River, his father told him to turn back and look at the country they wouldn\\u2019t likely return to. \",\n",

      "    \"In a product launch in Seattle, Washington, Alexa was the star as Amazon sought to widen the reach of its digital assistant powered by artificial intelligence amid a battle with rivals from Google, Apple, Microsoft and others.\",\n",
      "    \"Amazon began rolling out bilingual capabilities for Alexa, enabling it to perform in Spanish as well as English in the US; French along with English in Canada, and Hindi along with English in India, according to vice president of devices and services Dave Limp.\",\n",
      "    \"The celebrity voice option from Amazon follows a similar move by Google, which gave users the option of hearing celebrity singer John Legend on the Google Assistant last year.\",\n",
      "    \"Along with beefing up the Echo and Ring lines, Amazon introduced earbuds it touted as providing the first wearable, hands-free Alexa experience on the go.\",\n",

      "    \"Amazon added the ability to ask the voice-commanded digital assistant why it did something, or to reveal what it has heard. Alexa also got a feature that has it automatically delete voice recordings at specific intervals.\",\n",

After the growing interest in Scandinavian countries and South America, travel plans are now centred around events, says Akash Dahiya, CEO and co-founder of SanKash. The Gurgaon based travel fin-tech platform offers EMI-based payments for holidays, in partnership with over 260 travel platforms. \",\n",
      "    \"Since 2018, experiential music tourism within the country, to Ziro, Hornbill, Sunburn and NH7 Weekender, has been on the uptick, and now, millennials have set their sights abroad. The UN World Tourism Organisation estimates that around 50 million Indians will travel internationally this year, more than double the number in 2017. Couple this information with the fact that there has been a 55% growth in personal loans taken for travel \\u2014 of which 85% are by millennials (according to a report published earlier this year by digital lending platform, IndiaLends). \",\n",
      "    \"A 2018 study by Klook, a global travel activities and services booking platform, showed that 52% of Indians surveyed said they planned their vacations around seasonal activities and events.

India\\u2019s obsession with Oktoberfest is well known: this weekend, several hotels begin a month-long promotion of beers from across the world, with menus featuring Bavarian specials. International travellers, however, want to get the real deal. Such is the demand, that agencies like SOTC and Thomas Cook, and even smaller ones across the country, have special tour packages for the event. \\u201cThey take a couple of days in their Euro trip to halt at Munich and take in the festivities,\\u201d says Dahiya.

      "    \"In the battle of the biryanis, Arsalan\\u2019s potato-laden version has its staunch supporters. And sandesh isn\\u2019t the same unless it is from Balaram Mullick. The argument over who invented rosogolla can be solved over a couple of the sugar-soaked chhena dumplings \\u2014 we can conclude that it simply doesn\\u2019t matter. With Durga Puja around the corner, Bengalis around the country don\\u2019t have to travel all the way to Kolkata to sample these signature dishes. JustMyRoots (JMR), a food-tech platform, offers to bridge the gap by shipping speciality dishes from iconic restaurants to 21 cities across the country. \",\n",
      "    \"CEO and founder Samiran Sengupta says the idea is to tap into the nostalgia that India\\u2019s largely migrant population have for the food of their hometown. Apart from the sweets, savouries and cooked dishes, their offerings include fresh fish like hilsa and produce like gondhoraj lebu. The platform has also partnered with restaurants in Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai and Lucknow, with plans to expand to Chennai, Hyderabad and Kochi, among other cities, by the end of the year.\",\n",
      "    \"The concept is simple: visit the website or app and order like you would on a food-delivery platform like Swiggy or Zomato. The only difference is that you have to wait a few days before it reaches you. However, Sengupta reiterates that the food reaches their customer within 24 hours of being prepared. Another option that JMR offers is Direct From Home. \\u201cThis is a big hit with parents whose children stay in different cities. They can ship a home-cooked meal to their child for special occasions, or simply because they are missing home,\\u201d he explains. The food is picked up and packed much like it is from their restaurant partners, and delivered within the same time period. \",\n",
      "    \"Their other USP is the packaging, he says. Although other sites like PlaceOfOrigin.in ship sweets, snacks, dry fruits, namkeen, pickles, jams, tea and coffee, the fact that JMR deals with freshly-cooked dishes, put the focus on the supply chain. \\u201cWe spent nine months to a year just perfecting the packaging based on both customer and partner restaurant feedback. We finally settled on a product from Israel, which maintains the temperature of the food between five and eight degree Celsius, which is ideal for transportation,\\u2019\\u2019 he says. Customers will have to heat the food before consuming, as it will be maintained at this optimal temperature while it is being shipped. Future plans include expanding to China and other South East Asian countries by the end of this year, or early 2020, to cater to the Indian Diaspora population. It is also close enough to fulfill their 24 hour promise. \",\n",

The past few years of said surprises include improvements within voice assistants such as Apple\\u2019s Siri or Microsoft\\u2019s Cortana, or something as seemingly basic as your built-in News apps. These encompassing programmes, however, are \\u2018intelligent apps\\u2019. \",\n",
      "    \"While the name is fairly self-explanatory, let us get technical in terms of their modus operandi.

Such apps are capable of converging database and data warehouse workloads, operating with Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. \",\n",
      "    \"The home and quotidian life aren\\u2019t the only scopes for such apps; the workplace is too. Especially companies which develop these apps.\",\n",
      "    \" In a Medium blog post dated June 20, 2019, by Data Driven Investor, \\u201cToday\\u2019s digital natives demand much more than [simple mobile-enabled access to key business applications and data], they anticipate intelligent user experience and highly usable as offered by consumer apps. And, intelligent apps assure to provide the same.\\u201d\",\n",

      "    \"I-apps have been staring at you the whole time. In fact, we wouldn\\u2019t say there are apps that haven\\u2019t been made into i-apps at some point in their development timelines. For example, health trackers.\",\n",
      "    \"Microsoft has Bing Predicts which understands users\\u2019 patterns of web usage and even greater web trends and behaviours to get you answers fast, for the many types of questions you have. Bing then claims to verify concrete answers across multiple sources rather than just one. But what about more nuanced questions? Bing provides a carousel of answers gathered from the web, as well as info from the Reddit community.\",\n",
      "    \"Then there are i-apps used to precipitate inclusivity. Closer to home, Envision AI is used by the visually impaired to recognise their surroundings, but the Artificial Intelligence components take the notions of assistive technology to higher levels by having the app continually learn and make sense of hand-writing and Indian scripts.\",\n",
      "    \"Then there is the worry; the lip-gnawing and discomfort-inducing kind which has you considering throwing your phone into the nearest water body. We faced panic across fem-tech users, as Privacy International reported on September 9 how menstruation apps, which collect information about your health, your sexual life, your mood and more, could be sharing deeply personal data with Facebook. \\u201cWe, therefore, wanted to make sure that they keep this information to themselves, rather than sharing it with other companies\\u2026 We did a dynamic analysis of the apps using our data interception environment to look at the data that those apps share with Facebook\\u2026 As we will expose in this report, Maya by Plackal Tech (over 5 million downloads on Google Play) and MIA by Mobapp Development Limited conducted \\u2014 at the time of the research \\u2014 what we believe to be extensive sharing of sensitive personal data with third parties, including Facebook.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"This access is claimed to be due to Facebook\\u2019s SDK for Android feature, which allows app developers to bind their apps with Facebook\\u2019s platform. The feature contains a number of core components, such as analytics, graph API, login and even ads! Given medical data is considered to be the most personally confidential information we can have, many users were horrified by the terrifying side of i-apps.\",\n",

      "    \"Avalanche Studios\\u2019 first-person-shooter game, Rage 2 (released in May), with its maniacal bluster, deflated our expectations faster than a balloon pricked at a child\\u2019s birthday party. 2K Games\\u2019 Borderlands 3, hence, was expected to give us a much-needed fix of carnage and loot. Squarely falling under a sub-category of gaming called shlooters, the Borderlands series has prided itself over its abundance of loot, especially with Borderlands 2 providing, as it tagline claimed, a \\u2018Bazillion\\u2019 guns. After a disappointing Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 3 comes to us with more guns.\",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"The MacGuffin in the Borderlands series has always been a mythical vault on the planet Pandora, which is rumoured to have alien technology. It prompts widespread carnage as corporations and cults engage in an arms race and devastate the planet. With news that there are multiple vaults buried all over the planet, the various factions unite under one banner known as Children of the Vault, led by the Calypso twins, Troy and Tyreen Calypso.\",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"You play as one of the four vault hunters, Amara, a being of immense power and one of the six Sirens who can manifest multiple arms like an Indian goddess. Then there is FL4K, a robotic beastmaster who controls three pets. Moze is always accompanied by her 10-ton mecha and, as a gunner class, she is proficient with lots of guns. Zane is an operative that specialises in stealth, sabotage and espionage. The characters are fun and have their own styles. So you need to figure out what you want from this game before you choose.\",\n",
      "    \"The same tongue-in-cheek humour is back and is there throughout the game, from the return of Claptrap, the robot mascot of the game, to the talkative bad guys. Borderlands 2 set the bar high, in terms of antagonists, with Handsome Jack, the ruthless head of the Hyperion Corporation. The Calypsos aren\\u2019t as menacing. Thankfully, the game is filled with stuff to shoot \\u2014 the machine guns matter more than the narrative in this case. \",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"With your Gatling gun, grenade-launching mech and other mystical arms, you can cause large-scale devastation. The guns themselves are the stars of the show \\u2014 the Wild West-themed ones, slick futuristic ones, ones with mounted shields or automated legs and more. You also get guns that burn and freeze your enemies as you scream maniacally.\",\n",
      "    \"The game\\u2019s quests send you mindlessly ricocheting around the map, across several planets, as an excuse to shoot as you gather points, skills and advance to further levels. But the game makes you grind to progress, and it doesn\\u2019t help that enemies are bullet sponges, absorbing magazine after magazine before they go down. Hopefully, the makers fix this in the future.\",\n",
      "    \"To some extent, it feels like you\\u2019re living in a cartoon, thanks to the signature cell-shaded style of Borderlands, which looks the same as previous games. \",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"If you want a game to breeze through, this is the one for you. With excellent shooter mechanics, lots of loot, and more powers, Borderlands got the update it needed. \",\n",

I proceeded to scan a brief news report in Telugu with PV Sindhu and Mary Kom\\u2019s picture, and the translated text was quickly ready without any errors. However, it struggles to translate when the font is not similar to its database. For instance, the app couldn\\u2019t translate a provision store\\u2019s signboard. While translating the phrases, however, we learnt, short and well-structured sentences deliver the best results. Google and Hi Translate tend to translate word-for-word. On two occasions, their results were exactly the same. Hi Translate\\u2019s aggressive word-for-word translation engine falters when an English sentence has more than six words. On the other hand, Google handles long sentences well, but the translations are very formal. Despite minor tense-errors on three occasions out of five, Microsoft\\u2019s output is more colloquial, often omitting a word.\",\n",

Though the apps seamlessly translate sentences, the extremely formal translations could make even a hardcore Kannada speaker go scurrying for a dictionary. \",\n",

But for some rough edges, the translation of the brief text was pretty much precise, though if you look for word-for-word comparison, a phrase or two was slightly off target. However, the overall picture was clear. I then tried to translate the blurb of a Malayalam version of RK Narayan\\u2019s The Man-Eater of Malgudi that packed in some dense usages in a single, long sentence. The translation read like a summary of the text, nevertheless meaningful, as if the app applied its own brain to weed out some elements for the sake of simplification. Larger texts, such as name boards, are unpredictable, perhaps due to unrecognisable fonts. And, Malayalam is not supported in the \\u2018instant\\u2019 scan feature in Google and the results of its \\u2018hand-writing\\u2019 feature were generally all over the place.\",\n",

For one thing, some of the translations were quite formal, if not stilted, while both Google and Hi Translate often threw up similar results as if the same algorithm or intelligence were at work behind the scenes. While shorter sentences were impressive with their correctness, longer ones raised some question marks.\",\n",
      "    \"Google\\u2019s voice translation feature came across as a hit-or-miss affair, but largely usable with common sense. For instance, the word \\u2018fare\\u2019 (as in charges) in a test phrase from English to regional was misheard or misread or misinterpreted as \\u2018fire\\u2019 first and then still as \\u2018fair\\u2019 in successive attempts, processing the translation as \\u2018mela\\u2019 in Malayalam, thus completely distorting the semantics.

The problem with all three apps \\u2014 Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and Hi Translator for iOS \\u2014 is that they gave more or less the same textbook-Hindi versions of most phrases I asked them to help me with. The text/photo-scan feature on Hi Translator is a pay-only feature, and Microsoft doesn\\u2019t offer one at all.

      "    \"As students clock in for the post-lunch session at the Saraswathi Technical Institute in Puthur, Tiruchi, the hall slowly fills up with the \\u2018clackety-clack\\u2019 of 55 manual typewriters. For S Sampath Kumar, the principal and co-owner of the school started in 1952 by his father A Srinivasan, the sound is proof that the typewriter has saved itself from becoming obsolete, at least in Tamil Nadu.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThere was a brief drop in our market in 2002 when desktop computers overtook the manual typewriters in all offices. But after the State government made typing skills mandatory for public service postings, we were able to regain our lost clientele. Most government exams grant 20 bonus marks to candidates who have completed an English or Tamil typing certificate course,\\u201d says Sampath.\",\n",
      "    \"As a result, his school sees nearly 200 students per year, attempting the Junior (30 words per minute) or Senior (45 words per minute) six-month certificate courses in typing.\",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"The 1990s heralded the \\u2018Ice Age\\u2019 of manual and electrical typewriters, as desktop publishing (DTP) and digital technology upended the existing paper-driven model of working worldwide.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cTypewriters started turning up in junkyards. In fact, I picked my three samples from the trash,\\u201d says P Vijaykumar, a collector of antiques, coins and stamps in Tiruchi.\",\n",
      "    \"In Tamil Nadu, the manual typewriter\\u2019s revival has been scripted by public and private sector initiatives. That\\u2019s why, while many of the DTP and Internet browsing centres that opened in the early 2000s have closed down due to changing technology trends, the manual typewriter is back in vogue. The typewriter\\u2019s \\u2018QWERTY\\u2019 keyboard that has been replicated in electronic devices has helped it to stay relevant, say industry players.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cComputer centres often send their staff to us because electronic soft-touch keyboards get damaged faster than manual ones, when you don\\u2019t know how to type,\\u201d says Sampath Kumar. \\u201cBesides being accessible to students from Class 6 onwards, manual typing also teaches the typist how to spell words accurately. Our first lesson, after the history of typewriters, is to type the months of the year correctly.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \"Educational institutions like the Bharathiyar University in Coimbatore have made it compulsory for students to learn typing as part of their curriculum.\",\n",
      "    \"\",\n",
      "    \"The increasing emphasis on typing and correspondence skills in government offices has led to a fresh demand for people who can handle electronic and paper-based typing simultaneously.\",\n",
      "    \"The Directorate of Technical Education (DOTE) conducts the \\u2018Computer on Office Automation\\u2019 (COA) certificate course for students who have qualified in manual typing, to learn how to transfer their skills to electronic media. \",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThe Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNSPC) exams have created over 5,000 job openings per year. At least 2 lakh students attempt them once every six months,\\u201d says M Sathish Kumar, the Tiruchi coordinator of Tamil Nadu Typewriting Computer Institutes\\u2019 Association (TNTCIA). Launched in 2015, the industry grouping has 783 government-approved institutes on its rolls, that train students in typing and shorthand. Around 20 schools from Tiruchi district are part of TNTCIA.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cWe also cater to private Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies who ask us to train their fresh recruits in typing before they start work,\\u201d says Sathish Kumar, who runs a technical institute in Thuvakudi. \\u201cThose who have learned on a manual typewriter can easily adapt to an electronic keyboard. And with starting salaries of \\u20b915,000 to \\u20b918,000, typing has become an attractive job opportunity, especially for those from economically poor sections of society.\\u201d\",\n",
      "    \" \\n\",\n",
      "    \"The manual typewriter is reliving its boom in Tamil Nadu with just used machines. Godrej and Boyce stopped manufacturing typewriters in 2009, so users have had to make do with secondhand machines, that in turn require specialist mechanics for maintenance.\",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cTyping was a novelty in my school days, so my father, who ran a photo studio then, asked me to learn it,\\u201d says G Manohar, 59, among the last Godrej-trained typewriter repairers in Tiruchi. \\u201cUsually we buy used machines for \\u20b94000, and sell the repaired versions to institutes for \\u20b97000,\\u201d he says.\",\n",
      "    \"He manages to rotate spares between English typewriters, but says that those for Tamil machines are hard to find. \\u201cThe high demand for Tamil typewriters has led to a huge price rise \\u2014 a secondhand machine can cost up to \\u20b924,000,\\u201d he says.\",\n",
      "    \"Most of the machines need an overhaul at least once a month, says Sampath Kumar, who also cuts and winds the Kores brand 60-meter cotton cloth ribbon for his typewriters on black metal spools. \",\n",
      "    \"\\u201cThe lint from the ribbon and the dust in the air can jam up the keys,\\u201d he says. \\u201cBut despite all these hurdles, we are sure that typing will remain an essential skill for many more generations.\\u201d\",\n",
