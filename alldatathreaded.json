        "\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again appearing before Congress to face questions about his company\u2019s massive market power, privacy lapses and tolerance of speech deemed false or hateful.Mr. Zuckerberg has been summoned to testify at a hearing on Wednesday by the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s plan to create a global digital currency, which has stirred opposition from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and Europe. But the full range of policies and conduct of the social media giant with nearly 2.5 billion users will be under the public glare.It\u2019s the Facebook chief\u2019s first testimony to Congress since April 2018.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook's Zuckerberg faces Senate hearing \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFacebook's Zuckerberg faces Senate hearing The company seems to spark public and official anger at every turn these days, from its shift into messaging services that allow encrypted conversations to its alleged anticompetitive behavior to its refusal to take down phony political ads or doctored videos.Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have criticized Facebook\u2019s plan for the new currency, to be called Libra. They warn that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking.Rep. Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the Financial Services panel, this summer asked Facebook to not move forward with the currency and a digital wallet called Calibra that would be used with it. Waters has called Libra \u201ca new Swiss-based financial system\u201d that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.Several high-profile companies that had signed on as partners in Facebook\u2019s governing association for Libra have recently bailed, spelling a potentially rough road for the project. But many experts don\u2019t believe it\u2019s doomed.Mr. Zuckerberg, in written testimony prepared for the hearing, aimed to reassure lawmakers that his company won\u2019t try to evade financial regulators as it readies Libra.Facebook \u201cwill not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all U.S. regulators approve it,\u201d he said. That\u2019s a stronger statement than Facebook official David Marcus made to Congress in July, when he said the company will not activate Libra until it has \u201cfully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.\u201d Mr. Marcus leads the Libra project.Mr. Zuckerberg is striving to defend Libra and alleviate concerns that the currency could sidestep regulators. Analysts say Libra could avoid regulation and launch in countries where it\u2019s not getting pushback, but this doesn\u2019t appear to be Facebook\u2019s intention.Instead, Mr. Zuckerberg is pushing an optimistic vision of Libra and what it could mean for people around the world who don\u2019t have access to bank accounts.While some critics see the recent exodus of some Libra partners as evidence of the plan\u2019s likely failure, U.S. regulators appear to view it as enough of a threat that they are considering the possibility of the Fed launching its own competitor currency.\u201cAt the Federal Reserve, we will continue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies, and look forward to learning from other central banks,\u201d Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, said in a speech last week.There is concern among regulators that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.Mr. Zuckerberg also played the China card in his remarks, urging regulators to act quickly. \u201cWhile we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months,\u201d he said.The Facebook CEO also has cited competition from China as a compelling reason against breaking up the company.The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other huge tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, has advocated breaking up Facebook and other tech behemoths. She recently ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at Mr. Zuckerberg to protest the company\u2019s policy of not fact-checking politicians\u2019 speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.In a major speech last week at Georgetown University, Mr. Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s refusal to take down content from its platform it considers newsworthy \u201ceven if it goes against our standards.\u201dFacebook, Google and Twitter are trying to oversee Internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nMahendra Singh Dhoni is expected to watch the first day of the India-South Africa third Test in Ranchi on October 19, 2019.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nPTI\n An online search for cricketer M.S. Dhoni has the highest possibility of taking you to malicious websites, a cybersecurity company\u2019s study said on Tuesday. Other Indian celebrities in the list, whose names are used to lure unsuspecting fans to such websites, include actors Radhika Apte and Shraddha Kapoor, sportsperson P.V. Sindhu and also former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, the list prepared by McAfee said. Netizens often look for free and pirated content such as sports events, movies, TV shows, and images of their favourite superstars. Unfortunately, they may not be aware of the risks that malicious websites providing such content can pose, Venkat Krishnapur, its managing director for India, said.Mr. Krishnapur added the ease of access through multiple devices has also made it easy for the users to go on various websites to look for content they want. Dhoni and Tendulkar occupy the top honours in the Dangerous Celebrity list and the company attributed this to cricketers being larger than life personalities whose names resonate with lifestyle and entertainment audiences. Adult movie star turned Bollywood actor Sunny Leone is fourth on the list, behind reality show winning TV actor Gautam Gulati, the survey said. In what should cause concern, it said as the young, digital native population continues to spend more time online due to cheaper data and smart devices, they will continue to remain soft targets for cybercriminals who thrive on such user behavior. It has advised users to be careful on what they click, wait for the official release of content on safe websites rather than opting for third party ones, refrain from using illegal streaming sites, and use widely available security products to save themselves.

        "A drone-like flying taxi whirred over Singapore\u2019s waterfront on October 22, with the firm behind the test hoping the aircraft will revolutionise travel in traffic-choked Asian cities.Heavy rains in the morning almost delayed the flight, but the skies cleared in time for the battery-operated, two-seater taxi to quietly fly past skyscrapers.While the hover-taxis \u2014 resembling small helicopters but powered by drone-like technology \u2014 can fly autonomously, there was a pilot aboard during the test for safety reasons.",
        "\nFile photo shows apps for WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and other social networks on a smartphone \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n \u00a0The Supreme Court has decided to examine whether social media intermediaries such as Facebook and WhatsApp should facilitate the State to access encrypted and private conversations of citizens, purportedly to fight crime and terror.A Bench of Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose on Tuesday transferred to itself several pending cases in various High Courts on the issue and scheduled the hearing for January 2020 last week before an appropriate Bench.The court is waiting for the Centre to notify the revised Information Technology Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules by January 15. These Rules, said the government, were borne out of the present day neeed to usher in a stricter regime and more cooperation to combat the spread of pornography, sedition, hate, fake news, \u201canti-national activities and terror\u201d online.Justice Bose said the issue concerned individual privacy versus national interest.\u201cA terrorist cannot claim privacy,\u201d submitted Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal, along with Tamil Nadu Advocate General Vijay Narayan and Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan.\u00a0Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta said the government\u2019s move to gain more access into social media was not a \u201cploy\u201d and was triggered by a deep concern for the sovereignty of the nation. It was stemmed out of national interest.\u201cThe government has no intention to invade the privacy of innocents,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. Intermediaries should cooperate with the government to secure the nation against terror. \u201cYour Lordships have to find a balance between national interest, sovereignty and police investigation with individual privacy.\u201d\u00a0Mr. Mehta was reacting to submissions made by senior advocate Shyam Divan, for Internet Freedom Foundation, that the case was momentous and affected personal freedom. \u201cThe rights of citizens cannot be trampled upon,\u201d Mr. Divan submitted.Mr. Venugopal said Parliament had empowered the government through Section 69 (1) of the Information Technology Act to lawfully intercept, monitor and decrypt information through a computer resource if \u201csatisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence or for investigation of any offence\u201d.Mr. Venugopal argued, \u201cNow social media intermediaries can\u2019t come into the country and say they can\u2019t allow decryption.\u201dJustice Gupta remarked that the Section only allowed the government to lawfully decrypt information and did not entail any obligation on the part of the social intermediary concerned.Mr. Venugopal responded that the government did not want any technical assistance from the intermediary to crack encrypted social media traffic to fight crime. All it wanted was for the online platforms to facilitate access. \u201cThey will give us facilities to access the information, to access the entire counter system in which they are recording,\u201d he submitted.\u201cNot so simple. I don\u2019t have the key,\u201d senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for WhatsApp, responded to the argument.Justice Bose said the hardware may be located outside the country.\u201cLet them say so, we will take care of that,\u201d Mr. Venugopal replied.Mr. Rohatgi said the social media intermediaries were under no obligation to disclose details of private accounts. This would breach privacy.Justice Bose put matters in perspective, saying the social intermediaries could not claim protection under the fundamental rights of 19(1)(a) and (g) \u2014 right to free speech and right to practise any profession. \u201cYou are not an Indian citizen,\u201d he explained.\u201cI am not on my protection but on the protection of the rights of my clients [social media account holders],\u201d Mr. Rohatgi clarified.In a recent affidavit, the government said Internet had emerged as a potent tool to cause unimaginable disruption to the democratic polity.The affidavit was explaining to the apex court the need to revise rules to regulate social media intermediaries. The affidavit filed by the\u00a0Ministry of Information Technology said the regulatory regime required to be ramped up, considering the \u201cever-growing threats to individual rights and nation\u2019s integrity, sovereignty and security\u201d.The court hearing was based on a petition filed by Facebook for transfer of pleas concerning the linking of social media accounts to Aadhaar. Facebook and WhatsApp have argued that this would lead to loss of individual privacy. The Tamil Nadu government \u2014 one of the cases is pending in the Madras High Court \u2014 has argued that social media should be more transparent and cooperative with the police for purposes of crime detection, national security and so on.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "It will be the chant of a broken record player to say our eyes are more strained on a daily basis than they were 10 years ago. Gadgets have created ecosystems that suck us in from one screen to the other; phones ring on your laptop, your messages are delivered to your tablet, all this even as you are browsing Instagram on your phone, occasionally distracted by your smartwatch reminding you to stand up and take a few steps.SpecificationsPower: DC 5V 1ADimensions and weight: 208mm x 76mm x 106mm; 318 gModes: Sleep Mode (10 mins), Medium Mode (15 mins), Hard Mode (20 mins)Given we are saturated by exposure to blue and dark screens, ultimate self-care now must involve eye massages. At least this has been my takeaway since trying the Breo iSee4 \u2014 even if the device leaves me a little disappointed.The iSee4 wins in looks; adequately heavy, meaning that it is employing all that we like about a gravity blanket \u2014 the comfort of gentle weight on aching and tired parts of us, but does so while looking like a state-of-the-art AR device. If you are doing this in front of others, you are only bound to feel as foolish as the first time you tried the Google Cardboard... but at least this is cushioned.The puffing sounds from the air bags, as they snugly press into your temples and the balls of your closed eyelids might feel weird at first, but end up being therapeutic \u2014 perhaps reminiscent of little exhalations.The warm compress starts slow, having your eyes adjust to the temperature delicately. I have always found the suggestion to rub your palms till they warm up and then press them to your closed eyes, a little pointless. You would need to have cried all night for this to have any effect. The iSee4\u2019s warm compress, however, starts only after working the area a little \u2014 the gentle air bags shift with varying pressure across the eyes and temples, making the warmth actually soothing.There are only three modes on the device. A long-press powers the system on, by default into the Sleep Mode, and then there is Medium Mode and Hard Mode. These are displayed on a small LCD screen at the side. The latter two modes come with music while only the last mode comes with a vibration. To toggle between modes, you short-press the button, and to power off, you long-press again.iSee4 is also quite travel-friendly, given that it folds in half from the point where it sits on your nose. It does not flatten fully, but is compact enough. The strap is adjustable if you are sharing the device, and the cushioned section is low-maintenance; simply wipe with cotton soaked in alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy disappointment was primarily the audible dull motor sound, reminding you that this machine is working overtime to make you feel good. I am immediately distracted and already exhausted at its effort. If the makers have deliberately left this on, so as to mimic a sort of white or brown noise experience, it did not work for me.Also the music... if you are stressed and tired, this will annoy you; listen to it more than once, and you might as well be Alex from A Clockwork Orange. The sound alters between chirping birds, crickets, dripping water, and something resembling an ocean wave. The problem, though, is the short looping so that you can tell where each starts and ends. Think of this as an audio equivalent of a GIF or Boomerang, as opposed to a seamless easing into hypnosis.Clearly, with the addition of sound, Breo was going for a multi-sensory experience. With the proliferation of well-produced relaxing audio on meditation apps, this is a little lazy and left me feeling short-changed.While quantitatively, the pros outweigh the cons, the latter are quite an important part of the experience. I wish I had the option to turn the music on the Medium Mode and off the Hard Mode. More importantly, I wish the device were quieter \u2014 this doesn\u2019t seem like much to ask in 2019. If there is an option to try this device out (with hygienic measures) in-store before making a purchase, do try it before making a purchase.Available on Flipkart, GlobalKart and Bed Bath & Beyond starting at \u20b96,000You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The regulatory regime had to be ramped up considering the \u201cever-growing threats to individual rights and the nation\u2019s integrity, sovereignty, and security.\u201dIt said the new Information Technology Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules would be notified by January 15, 2020.

Internet had led to an exponential rise in \u201canti-national activities.\u201dThe government said in the \u201clast few years there has been an enormous increase in the use of social media, and with lower Internet tariffs, availability of smart devices and last-mile connectivity, more and more people in India are becoming part of the Internet/social media platforms.\u201d\u201cIf on the one hand technology has led to economic growth and societal development, on the other hand there has been an exponential rise in hate speech, fake news, public order, anti-national activities, defamatory postings, and other unlawful activities using Internet/social media platforms,\u201d the Centre told the apex court.The government said Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had addressed the Rajya Sabha on July 26 last year on the issue of misuse of social media platform and propagation of fake news. He had assured the House that the government would initiate a number of measures, including amendments in the existing Intermediaries Guidelines Rules, 2011, to make intermediaries more liable for the content that was published, transmitted, etc, on their platforms.The government said detailed discussions were on at various levels, including inter-ministerial, as the issue was complex and concerned the functioning of netizens, government departments/ministries, social media platforms, messaging platforms, websites and mobile apps. The government said efforts were on to make the Rules \u201ceffective, robust and comprehensive.\u201dThe case is scheduled to be heard on October 22.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University, on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in Washington. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n A defiant Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stressed that his platform has now become a \u2018Fifth Estate\u2019 in the world alongside traditional news media and people no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard.Delivering a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, DC on Thursday, he said social media platforms have decentralised power by putting it directly into people\u2019s hands.\u201cPeople having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world \u2014 a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, apparently challenging those who wish to break up the social networking giant. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Luther King's daughter tells Facebook disinformation helped kill civil rights leader\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMartin Luther King's daughter tells Facebook disinformation helped kill civil rights leader\nSenators and presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are pitching hard to break up Facebook, amid regulators scrutinising the company over anti-competitive practices and privacy scandals.\u201cPeople no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard, and that has important consequences,\u201d he added.\u201cI understand the concerns about how tech platforms have centralised power, but I actually believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralised power by putting it directly into people\u2019s hands. It\u2019s part of this amazing expansion of voice through law, culture and technology,\u201d the Facebook CEO elaborated.Mr. Zuckerberg also said the company does not fact-check political ads.\u201cWe don\u2019t fact-check political ads. We don\u2019t do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. And if content is newsworthy, we also won\u2019t take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards,\u201d he said.\u201cOf course there are exceptions, and even for politicians we don\u2019t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm \u2014 and of course we don\u2019t allow voter suppression. Voting is voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg added.In an apparent embarrassment for Facebook, Ms. Warren run a fake ad on the social media platform that claimed \u201cMark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election\u201d.Unhappy over Facebook\u2019s announcement that it exempts politicians\u2019 posts from third-party fact-checking, the Massachusetts Senator intentionally made the ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved.\u201cIt got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook. It changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies \u2014 explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes,\u201d Ms. Warren had tweeted.Mr. Zuckerberg replied to Ms. Warren in his speech: \u201cI know many people disagree, but, in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we\u2019re not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run these same ads\u201d.\u201cPolitical ads are an important part of voice \u2014 especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favours incumbents and whoever the media covers,\u201d he added.Even if we wanted to ban political ads, he said, it\u2019s not clear where we would draw the line.\u201cThere are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections. Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women\u2019s empowerment? If we banned candidates\u2019 ads but not these, would that really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates themselves?\u201d argued Mr. Zuckerberg.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        " Facebook on Wednesday announced the second phase of its \u2018GOAL\u2019 initiative under which the social networking giant is helping tribal girls from across India to become village-level digital young leaders for their communities. The second phase of the programme \u2014 launched by Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda \u2014 will digitally mentor 5,000 young women in India\u2019s tribal dominated districts. Launched earlier this year in March, Going Online as Leaders (GOAL) connects underprivileged young women from tribal areas with senior expert mentors in the areas of business, fashion and arts to learn digital and life skills.\u201cThrough this partnership, the GOAL programme will provide economically and socially marginalised young women with the tools and guidance they need to succeed, using technology they may otherwise have not had access to,\u201d Mr. Munda said. The initiative will include weekly one-to-one mentoring sessions that focus on a range of skills such as digital literacy, entrepreneurship and online safety. Overall, more than 2,00,000 hours of guidance will be provided using Facebook family of apps including WhatsApp and Messenger. Following the programme, the participants will graduate to the GOAL alumni and will continue to receive support and guidance from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Facebook. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs will also work with district administration and other government agencies to help secure qualified participants with a fellowship, so they can put their newly learned skills to work. More than 125 young women have enrolled for the programme. Facebook India Head Ajit Mohan said about 30-35% of women in India have access to Internet in India.\u201cWe are committed to investing in ways to address this gap and bring the power of Internet to more women in India,\u201d he added. Facebook India Director of Policy Ankhi Das said this programme is important because it actively supports these young women to build leadership qualities and encourages them to be champions and help share their learnings with others.

        "\nA woman takes a look on the new Google Pixel 4 smartphone displayed during a Google launch event in New York City\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n If you happened to be watching the October 15 \u2018Made By Google\u2019 event livestream for the Pixel 4 and 4 XL, which wasn\u2019t exactly met with a massive amount of enthusiasm. As far as Pixel 4 goes, this model has to be one of the most leaked smartphones in recent history; everything from specs to design were out on the global table\u2026 and for a while now, the Internet has been brimming with multiple detailed hands-on videos.The device, priced at $799, is to be released across major markets on October 24 \u2013 except India. According to an official spokesperson at Google, the Pixel 4 \u201cGoogle has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends, and product features. We decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India. We remain committed to our current Pixel phones and look forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\u201dSo what are we missing here? There are three colours for the models: Just Black, Clearly White, and a limited edition Oh So Orange. They now also have a rear dual-camera system, which isn\u2019t much of a surprise. The Pixel 4 features a 5.7-inch display, while the Pixel 4 XL has a 6.3-inch screen. What Google dubs \u2018Smooth Displays\u2019 come with a refresh rate of 90Hz (which has been the talk of many tech brands such as OnePlus), a first for any Pixel phone\u2026 but this could do more harm than good considering there isn\u2019t much of an upgrade in the Pixel 4 series\u2019 battery life. The phones could up the RAM from 4GB to 6GB this time around. The Pixel 4 series is fuelled by the Snapdragon 855 SoC, rather than the on-trend 855 Plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Google Pixel 4 smartphones are displayed during a Google launch event in New York City, New York, U.S.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nReuters\n \n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant is also said to be far more deeply embedded in the OS (Android 10 out of the box for this one), meaning more intuitive and speedy responses when interacting with the device. One of the newest features for the Pixel 4 series is that it claims to have the fastest face unlock system on any smartphone; fingers point to the company\u2019s new motion-sensing Soli chip next to the front-facing camera sensor. For the Pixel 4 series, Google\u2019s omitted the strategically-placed fingerprint sensor, replacing the security features with facial recognition unlock and basic PIN entry. The camera, one of Pixel\u2019s highest selling points, has undergone a further boost with astrophotography facilities, learning-based white balancing features and a wider range Portrait mode. Then there\u2019s the new Live HDR+ which will let users preview HDR+ processing in the camera app before taking the photo, and the Dual Exposure controls which gives users the power to adjust shadows and highlights in a shot before taking the photo.That said, it doesn\u2019t seem like the lack of availability of the Pixel 4 will keep Google loyalists or new demographics from finding ways to buy the phone.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The extent of cyberspace was wider than the national boundaries and \u201cexercising effective jurisdiction over it is a very difficult task.\u201d Terrorists were using \u201cInternet-based social media platforms and communication tools to encrypt data\u201d and \u201cstrengthened the planning and execution of events through Deep Web and Darknet,\u201d the Minister said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nNew York-based comic artist Nathan W Pyle at the 2019 Hyderabad leg of Comic India at Hitex Exhibition Centre \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani   Comic Con India made the right choice by placing Nathan W Pyle\u2019s Strange Planet booth close to the front of 2000-pax capacity Hitex\u2019s Exhibition Hall last weekend... However, the space around the booth wasn\u2019t big enough for the hundreds who flocked to get autographed posters from the illustrator. Each fan, having waited about 20 minutes to meet Nathan, enthusiastically told him how the blue beings\u2019 invasion of their social media feeds cheers them up.Fortunately, the MetroPlus interview with Nathan is in a quiet room, scheduled ahead of his meeting with Strange Planet fans, away from the floor-thumping bass of music, video games and spontaneous announcements.Nathan and his wife Taylor aren\u2019t strangers to Comic Cons; they just finished up at New York \u2014 one of the biggest comic conventions in the world. The excitement continues for the couple as this is not just their first trip to India, but also a chance to interact with a different sphere of creativity and a diverse fan-base. The success story of Strange Planet is remarkable given it launched only in February 2019 and Nathan\u2019s Instagram account now has over 4.3 million followers. The comics are unique in that the doe-eyed blue beings that star in them have neither race nor gender. They also speak in a charming, if mind-bending version of English. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the posts from \u2018Strange Planet\u2019 by Nathan W Pyle. This comic is from October 11, titled \u2018s t r i k i n g\u2019 \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nNathan W Pyle  \n\n\n\n\n\nOn the morning Nathan landed in India, the Strange Planet Instagram post titled \u2018striking\u2019 shows a boxing lesson between blue beings, which they term \u201crecreational face striking.\u201d In the same post, push-ups are labelled \u201clet-downs.\u201d Then there is the much-craved \u201cstar damage,\u201d a very literal take on sun tans. Thanks to today\u2019s infinite scroll culture, it is easy to find yourself chuckling at the beings\u2019 quotidian antics without realising you have probably gone through months\u2019 worth of content. \u201cLanguage is at the heart of Strange Planet\u2019s humour,\u201d says Nathan, \u201cand it is neat that everywhere you go, English is used but differently \u2014 especially because language is elastic and evolving. It is a spice to help create a new experience. See, we don\u2019t use the word \u2018sustenance\u2019 as much these days, but in Strange Planet, it can sound futuristic \u2014 irony!\u201d He is alluding to his September 17 post \u2018affirm\u2019 where a character is \u201cunsure of which sustenance to purchase.\u201d Pageturner Nathan\u2019s book Strange Planet will launch in late November, courtesy Hachette India. The book will feature never-before-seen comics and more two-part comics. \u201cIt was hard to condense all I\u2019ve created into this singular book, but would love to create more of larger story.\u201dLike every creator out there, Nathan has a method to his madness, and his approach to visual design requires balance. The lines of Strange Planet are simple and the colours in each comic are minimal. \u201cWe want for the words to be legible so I do clear a lot of space. Maybe a character will be pushed to the side but the words are important. In some comics, even where characters are doing a lot of physical exertion, they don\u2019t have added muscle.\u201d Creating content for the digital space is largely a win for Nathan. \u201cThere is a malleability online; as creators, we can post when we want to and directly communicate with audiences. On Facebook, I post the comic in black-and-white while Instagram gets colour versions; this is deliberate in case I want to tweak anything language-wise for the Instagram version while adding colour.\u201d Nathan does not want to remove the mystique of what these adorable characters actually sound like in his head. Does he speak like them sometimes? Taylor smirks a little, explaining, \u201cSometimes we will be walking around New York City and he will be like this [Closes her eyes, tilts her head back a little and shakes her hands loosely at her sides, to which Nathan laughs], and that is when he is clearly creating what the beings are saying. I can tell he will be talking like they are.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York-based comic artist Nathan W Pyle signing comic posters for fans at the 2019 Hyderabad leg of Comic India at Hitex Exhibition Centre \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNathan tacks on, \u201cWell, it has been 238 days in a row that I have posted a comic. So with that output of a comic a day, Taylor is definitely hearing out my ideas \u2014 a beta audience, if you will.... she is very honest and has shot down a few ideas too!\u201d It is no secret that Hyderabad is amok with pigeons. So when Nathan and Taylor observed the same at Golconda Fort, Nathan instantly got to filming videos of pigeons for his other equally-intriguing Instagram account \u2018Pigeons by Nathan\u2019 which chronicles the oddities of these birds. \u201cHyderabad pigeons are more fit and friendly than New York pigeons which are more aggressive,\u201d observes Nathan, \u201c\u2018Pigeons by Nathan helps me when I am stuck creatively; I will watch the way pigeons interact and form a story out of it, because they are all different in movement and character... and Taylor is very patient with that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan W Pyle\u2019s \u2018Strange Planet\u2019 usually has positive spirits around love and acceptance \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nNathan W Pyle\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor jokes, \u201cI am okay in the summer... but then there\u2019s the four-degree Fahrenheit winters when he is filming pigeons.\u201d Given a large portion of fans are Indian, Nathan says early conversations with Comic Con India founder Jatin Varma were encouraging. He says, \u201cThere are obviously some brands [Taylor and I] know and then there are ones we don\u2019t know. We are not just looking forward to knowing more about entertainment in Hyderabad but also within the comics space. In Hyderabad, there is a real appreciation for technology and for food too.\u201d He says he had \u201clentil doughnut\u201d for breakfast (vada), that that they dined at Ohri\u2019s the day before. He adds that he is looking for some authentic Hyderabadi biryani next.If you are wondering whether this trip to India will have an impact on Strange Planet, Nathan\u2019s got an interesting new idea up his sleeve. He says that just that morning he drew a blue being in an auto or \u201cthree-wheeled roll machines.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "Today's Google Doodle celebrates the search engine's 21st birthday.On this day in 1998, Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, two Ph.D. students from Stanford, came up with the idea of launching a prototype of a \u201clarge-scale search engine\". \"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol [10 to the power of 100, or 1 followed by 100 zeroes] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines,\u201d they wrote in their paper.Their mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\", and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\". Google, operating today in over 100 languages, is considered one of the Big Four technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple and Facebook. Now, the verb \"google\" has been added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\"Google Doodles, too, have been part of the company since its inception. The very first Doodle was in honour of the Burning Man Festival of 1998. It was designed by Page and Brin themselves to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent ones were designed by an outside contractor, until the founders asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From then on, Doodles have been organised and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".As of October 2016, Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries. Alexa, a commercial web traffic monitoring company, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger.Google has often come under fire over issues of aggressive tax avoidance, search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content, and privacy.However, it continues to answer trillions of search queries each year.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nVishal Sikka\n\u00a0 Former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, who has announced a new AI startup with USD50 million fund, believes India has the potential to become a world leader in artificial intelligence but the key to this is integrating AI into the country\u2019s education system in a massive way.India is at \u201can inflection point\u201d when it comes to AI or artificial intelligence, Mr. Sikka said.Over the next 20-25 years, AI is going to be \u201ca very, very big disruptor\u201d for the Indian society because what one is seeing now in terms of automation and job losses is just the beginning, said Mr. Sikka, who announced his startup Vianai Systems last week.\u201cBut on the other hand, if we are able to bring AI education, the ability to build AI systems to India at a very large scale, and I\u2019m talking about like billion plus people, then India can really leap frog and become the world\u2019s leader in artificial intelligence, in AI skill and AI talent,\u201d Mr. Sikka told PTI in an exclusive interview.Doing that requires working on multiple dimensions in parallel, he said.Last month, at the request of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Sikka gave a presentation before the NITI Aayog how to expand the reach of AI to the Indian society in a very big way.Representatives of some 20 Union Ministries were present during his presentation on AI and India. This, he said, required creating necessary infrastructure to bring the talent through institutions, schools and educational institutions, the ability to do AI education at a large scale.According to Mr. Sikka, the Prime Minister said he personally saw whenever classes worked into digital classrooms, he was joking that children would sometimes even forget to eat their lunch because they were so engrossed in learning. \u201cIt was very encouraging. But I think a lot of that has to be done,\u201d he said and suggested multi-faceted countrywide programme like digital classrooms.If India does nothing then this great wave of AI is going to have massive disruption over the next 20 years. But on the other hand, if it puts together programmes then this can be a huge advantage for it and \u201cwe can be a leader in the world,\u201d he said.Referring to his interactions with the Indian government officials and the steps being taken by Mr. Modi, Mr. Sikka said he is very encouraged by the commitment.His Vianai Systems is an AI Enterprise Platform startup with a mission to help businesses around the world successfully leverage AI to drive fundamental digital transformations.He said there have been remarkable achievements in the field of AI, but conceded that significant issues too have emerged in the field of artificial intelligence.\u201cThe technique themselves are quite opaque, not transparent. The lack of ability to explain is one of the major weaknesses of these techniques,\u201d Mr. Sikka said.He said that there is an incredible shortage of talent in the field of AI.With this in backdrop, Mr. Sikka said he started this venture to build a platform that can dramatically improve the accessibility of AI, that is educational, that explains to people how this works, that they can experiment with it, they can play with it, they can explore and understand what is happening.\u201cThat is what my prototype was about,\u201d said Mr. Sikka as he went back to his PhD thesis on AI in 90s.For its mass application in a transparent manner, he said there is a need to build a platform that is a dramatic improvement on what is available today.Mr. Sikka has raised USD50 million as the startup seed money.\u201cHopefully, we wouldn\u2019t have to raise any money again,\u201d he said, adding that the objective is to bring AI to businesses on massive scale. Last week, he demonstrated the first glimpse of the platform at the Oracle Open World event in the Silicon Valley.One of the reasons that there are so few applications of engineer machine learning is because the techniques and the tools are extremely dense, they are complicated, the experience of developer is broken profound.\u201cSo we wanted to make it dramatically simpler to access an AI system and to execute on AI. His platform dramatically simplifies the AI system from thousands of lines of codes to a few dozens of lines of codes. This will make the systems much much simpler,\u201d he said.\u201cWe have been thinking very carefully, and very diligently about how we can come up with a platform that is completely agnostic, completely open and yet makes it dramatically simpler, and more efficient and more exploratory to build an AI system. And with that when you think about a future where enterprises will deploy dozens, if not hundreds of AI applications, you need something like this to make that happen. And that\u2019s what we are working on,\u201d Mr. Sikka said.Last week, he announced a panel of advisors from industry and academia for Vianai. They include Henning Kagermann, former chairman and CEO of SAP and chairman of Acatech; Alan Kay, Turing Award winner and computer science pioneer; Divesh Makan, founder of ICONIQ Capital; Indra Nooyi, member of the board at Amazon and Schlumberger and former CEO of PepsiCo; and Sebastian Thrun, CEO of Kitty Hawk Corporation and co-founder and chairman of Udacity.\u201cEvery company that hopes to be a leader in their industry needs to understand the transformative potential of AI, and to successfully activate it within their organisations,\u201d said Nooyi in a statement.\u201cThe market need is immense, and Vianai, with its capable leadership and differentiated platform, is in a unique position to address it. I look forward to being an advisor to the company in the exciting times ahead,\u201d she said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nPete Lau, Founder and CEO of OnePlus with the new and highly anticipated OnePlus 7T.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nV. V. Krishnan  China-based mobile phone maker OnePlus launched its latest offerings, the One Plus 7T phone and the One Plus TV, in India on September 26.One Plus 7T: 8GB/128GB: \u20b937,999; 8GB/256GB: \u20b939,999The OnePlus 7T has three cameras, much like its predecessor, but they\u2019re arranged horizontally this time, inside a circular notch \u2014 perhaps replicating the more natural experience of how we use our eyes. In an interview, the General Manager of OnePlus India Vikas Agarwal had earlier said that this new setting was a \u201cbold move\u201d aesthetically.The three cameras are a 48MP primary, an 117-degree ultra wide camera and a 2x telephoto camera.Noticing the sort of macro shots being populated under the #shotononeplus, One Plus decided to have macro motors that\u2019d allow users to shoot from just 2.5 cm away from a subject.There is now an independent motor drive for just the haptics, too, for a better gaming experience.As for India centric features, OnePlus has announced a live cricket score widget on the minus one screens or shelves, improvements to their photo gallery to sort photos based on subject into smart albums (recognising faces, or actions and themes). All of this, they say, happens within the device itself and without internet connectivity \u2014 thereby ensuring privacy and efficient processing.To hoots and cheers, the company also announced a 5GB cloud storage should the user wish to upload photos, and an extra 50GB free storage for the first year for OnePlus 7T users.While a lot of these features might sound familiar for other premium smartphone users, what was really neat was their Work-Life Balance mode. Now, apps that you typically use for work will be in the \u2018Work\u2019 mode of the phone, while apps you use for friends, family, and non-work-related engagements, will be in the \u2018Life\u2019 mode. While on one mode, notifications from apps native to the other mode, will be in a kind of DND.They\u2019ve even added intelligence to this, with the OnePlus 7T picking up a change in location, or wifi connection, to automatically switch between these modes for you.The SMS sorting into spam and a \u2018focussed\u2019 folder of sorts (like on an Outlook email box or the more recent iOS rollouts) will prove to be a nifty feature, especially for the Indian context, where receiving advertorial spam is common.OnePlus TV: Q1 55-inch \u2014 \u20b969,900; Q1 Pro 55-inch \u2014 \u20b999,900 (available only in India)The TV will have a 55inch screen, and will use QLED technology. It has 4K resolution, and uses the Gamma Color Magic processor. But what really stands out as a differentiator for the OnePlus TV is retractable, sliding sound bar. There are 6 speakers facing the front of the TV, and 2 facing the back. Together, they will produce a 50W sound output (in comparison to a 20-40W sound output for any other high end TV in the market).The sliding motion of the sound bar comes with longevity for close to 100,000 motions \u2014 and this sliding itself will be quieter than the quietest of air conditioners, says OnePlus, at 32 decibels only.The OnePlus TV\u2019s carbon-fiber reinforced back panel comes with a magnetic plate into which all ports are neatly hidden. At its thinnest, the TV is 7 mm, and has a 95.7 percent screen-to-body ratio. However, design-wise, the remote doesn\u2019t seem entirely new \u2014 no numbers, minimal buttons.Use the TV to play music from your phone or and stream games as you\u2019re playing them, via bluetooth. The OnePlus TV comes with the Android TV 9, and is compatible with Alexa. The controlling via smartphone that they did a live demo of during the launch, seemed very similar to the operationality of the Amazon Firestick (trackpad on your phone to navigate the TV screen, type on your phone keyboard, instead of searching for letters on the TV screen).You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "Once a practising lawyer in the United States, Sangeeta Jain \u2014 \u201colder than an average TikTok user\u201d \u2014 is now a star, popularly known as Geet, on the platform. She has two channels on the video platform: on the first, @TheOfficalGeet, she puts up motivational, self-care, and self-help videos; on the second, @EnglishWithGeet, she shares snippet-sized spoken English lessons. \u201cHindi se English seekhne ke liye mere saath TikTok par judd jayiye,\u201d is her consistent sign off. Geet, who grew up in Seattle, wanted to be an actor. A childhood accident though, paralysed her waist-down. Her dependence on a wheelchair had kept her from breaking into the film industry. After being back-and-forth between India and the U.S., to work with children and at-risk youth here, in 2014 Geet participated on a Zee TV reality show, India\u2019s Best Cinestars ki Khoj. She couldn\u2019t make it past the dance rounds.\u201cWith that, the acting keeda had come back again,\u201d she says. In August 2015, with her brother\u2019s encouragement, she started her own Facebook Page. But not knowing what would work, she started with motivational videos. She took this to TikTok in February last year, while also putting up comedy shorts that she made with her 87-year-old grandmother. \u201cBut to my surprise, it was the motivational videos that did better; we had videos on socially relevant topics like domestic violence, saas bahu relationships, and confidence. I was getting thousands and views and comments even within the first few weeks,\u201d recalls Geet.Over time, noticing that her Hindi was weaker than her English, which she still speaks with an American accent, her audience started writing in with special request to clarify something. And so it began. She started with simple vocabulary (\u201cgorgeous\u201d instead of saying \u201cvery pretty\u201d) or correcting common mistakes (saying \u201cladies\u201d even for singular usage, instead of \u201clady\u201d). Her mother and grandmother starred in the video, acting like two people in conversation who didn\u2019t know the right usage. Today, Geet (she has about 4.5M followers on TikTok, 51.4k subscribers on YouTube and 5.4M followers on Facebook) also makes videos where she teaches English by translating a couple lines from popular Hindi songs. On Facebook and YouTube, she does a three-minute long series, which she makes and stars in, with other actors.Given her legal training in the United States, Geet says she believes in the freedom of speech.

        "\nIn this photo, a smartphone screen shows North Korean refugee Jang Myung-jin as he films himself in a demonstration of his YouTube broadcast during an interview at his house in Seoul, South Korea.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Wearing a fedora, Jang Myung-jin shouts \u201cHello, comrades!\u201d as he starts his YouTube broadcast, titled \u201cA North Korean man, Tango.\u201d Then, he talks about whether North Koreans raise pet dogs, what type of profanity they use and whether there are any transgender people in the country. The 32-year-old Jang is among a handful of young North Korean refugees in South Korea who have launched YouTube channels that offer a rare glimpse into the everyday lives of people in North Korea, one of the world\u2019s most secretive and repressive countries. While mainstream outside media reports on North Korea focus on heavy subjects like the North\u2019s nuclear program or its internal power hierarchy, these young YouTubers feed a growing demand for softer news related to daily life in their former home country. Their rise comes amid increased public attention to North Korea, whose young leader, Kim Jong Un, has made global headlines with a provocative run of weapons tests and high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump. \u201cThere are people who yearn for real scenes showing how people in North Korea live. There is a niche market for that,\u201d said Jeon Young-sun, a research professor at Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University. \u201cSimply speaking, some people are curious about what beer North Koreans drink and what cookies they eat.\u201d Jang uses his Samsung smartphone to film himself at his small Seoul apartment, and sometimes invites fellow North Korean refugees as guests and has friends shoot him when he ventures out. He often appears with his trademark dark fedora, but sometimes with a colourful wig, a false mustache or even a Kim Jong Un mask. Video clips uploaded on Jang\u2019s 2-year-old channel showed him saying that ordinary North Koreans usually raise dogs, rabbits, pigs and chickens, but to either eat or sell to markets. He said that calling someone \u201ca baby born by a young female slave\u201d is considered a profanity in North Korea, and that people there say \u201cDo you want to have the order of your ribs revolutionarily reorganised?\u201d when trying to intimidate others. Jang, who has about 7,000 subscribers to his channel, said he does manual labour and delivers fried chicken as a means of living because his YouTube-related income is too small. But he feels it\u2019s worth it to keep his YouTube career going because some subscribers have left messages saying his broadcasts helped resolve their misunderstandings of North Korea. \u201cThey cheer me up and make me be positive. They are the reasons why I shoot YouTube videos today and tomorrow,\u201d Jang said, petting his Maltese. Other North Korea-born YouTubers talk about why they left their homeland and the experiences they\u2019ve had in South Korea. Some also broadcast themselves putting on North Korean-style makeup or eating foods from the country. The young YouTubers are mostly stylish, contrary to the stereotype of North Korean refugees as being rough and unsophisticated. About 32,000 North Koreans have fled to the South over the past two decades to avoid poverty and political repression. Kang Na-ra, a North Korean escapee who regularly appears on two YouTube channels and two TV programs, is called \u201cPrincess Na-ra\u201d by her fans. The 22-year-old with long, brown-dyed hair said she has a 200-member fan club that has sent her a cake topped with a mini-Kang doll on her birthday for the past three years. When Kang, dressed in a North Korean military uniform, showed how to put on North Korean-style makeup on her YouTube channel, her subscribers wrote, \u201cYou are so pretty even without makeup\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re such a beauty.\u201d \u201cI like communicating with people by posting responses to the messages that they put on my channel,\u201d said Kang, wearing two rings on each of her hands. \u201cI want to let the people know about North Korean culture and show more about how I am living in South Korea.\u201d The YouTubers, however, also have anti-fans who often vent their anger at them when North Korea does something provocative like conduct a weapons test. Kang said she feels a \u201clittle sad\u201d when she reads malicious messages from people such as \u201cGo back to your country\u201d and \u201cWhy does a Red live here?\u201d Jang said some messages have been left for him wishing for him to be assassinated with a poisoned needle or banished to a North Korean coal mine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this photo, North Korean refugee Jang Myung-jin edits his YouTube footage during an interview at his house in Seoul, South Korea. \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nAP\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there have been some TV programs in the South featuring North Korean refugees, some experts say they don\u2019t fully carry the escapees\u2019 voices because they were directed, filmed and edited by South Koreans. \u201cOn YouTube, defectors can speak whatever they want without being filtered and edited. ... Given that, I would say their programs provide content that the TV shows can\u2019t provide,\u201d said Lee Kwang Baek, the South Korean head of a YouTube channel on North Korea. Their YouTube programs are also believed to help address the widespread misinformation about North Korea in the South. Jang said a middle school student once asked him if North Koreans eat dirt when they\u2019re hungry, while another escapee-turned-YouTuber, Lee Pyung, said he was asked whether North Koreans give potatoes instead of money to a driver when they take a bus. The YouTubers\u2019 most popular content is stories of their dangerous escapes to South Korea. Kang\u2019s escape story, posted on someone else\u2019s YouTube channel last year, has received about 1.7 million views. She said she thought she was going to die when she was carried away by water while crossing the Tumen River to go to China before coming to South Korea in December 2014. Kang said she ran away from her home in North Korea after fighting with her stepmother. Then her biological mother, who had already resettled in South Korea, hired brokers who helped her come to the South about two weeks later. Besides her longing for her mother, Kang said her wishes to wear jeans, dye her hair and date handsome South Korean men also pushed her to make a perilous journey to the South. Jang hasn\u2019t posted his escape story yet because he said he wants to fill his channel with more amusing content. Jang said he had a big crush on the 11-year-old girl with fair skin and big eyes, who lived with her grandmother. He recalled how the two would hold hands when he walked her to her house. After the girl didn\u2019t come to school for two to three weeks, their teacher asked Jang to go and check on her. When he arrived at her home, he found the girl, then all skin and bones, lying dead with her eyes and mouth open, while her grandmother had disappeared. Terrified, Jang immediately bolted out of the house and reported the girl\u2019s death to neighbors before crying all day. A few months later, he fled North Korea with his parents and younger brother. Before his family walked across the frozen Tumen River, his father told him to turn back and look at the country they wouldn\u2019t likely return to. \u201cWhile looking at my hometown for about five minutes, I thought about that girl,\u201d Jang said. \u201cI thought that her only fault was being born in the wrong country,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf she had come to South Korea, she wouldn\u2019t have starved to death ... and could have become a YouTuber like me.\u201d You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nInside the Loewenbraeu brewery's festive tent at Oktoberfest in Munich\n\u00a0 A few years back, South East Asia was the destination of choice for most first-time travellers from India. This was followed by mainland Europe \u2014 Rome, Venice and Paris. After the growing interest in Scandinavian countries and South America, travel plans are now centred around events, says Akash Dahiya, CEO and co-founder of SanKash. The Gurgaon based travel fin-tech platform offers EMI-based payments for holidays, in partnership with over 260 travel platforms. Since 2018, experiential music tourism within the country, to Ziro, Hornbill, Sunburn and NH7 Weekender, has been on the uptick, and now, millennials have set their sights abroad. The UN World Tourism Organisation estimates that around 50 million Indians will travel internationally this year, more than double the number in 2017. Couple this information with the fact that there has been a 55% growth in personal loans taken for travel \u2014 of which 85% are by millennials (according to a report published earlier this year by digital lending platform, IndiaLends). A 2018 study by Klook, a global travel activities and services booking platform, showed that 52% of Indians surveyed said they planned their vacations around seasonal activities and events. Abhinandan Sangam, co-founder and CTO of Finzy, a peer-to-peer lending platform that offers personal loans from \u20b950,000 to \u20b95 lakh, says that around 15% of their patrons (aged 24 to 39) use the money for travel. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that the Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan, La Tomatina in Spain and the Carnaval in South American countries have a lot of takers,\u201d he adds. Finzy, too, has partnered with around 20 travel agencies offering experiential holidays. Both Dahiya and Sangam agree that Bollywood has helped direct attention towards these event-based trips. India\u2019s obsession with Oktoberfest is well known: this weekend, several hotels begin a month-long promotion of beers from across the world, with menus featuring Bavarian specials. International travellers, however, want to get the real deal. Such is the demand, that agencies like SOTC and Thomas Cook, and even smaller ones across the country, have special tour packages for the event. \u201cThey take a couple of days in their Euro trip to halt at Munich and take in the festivities,\u201d says Dahiya. And presumably, all the brands of beer that they couldn\u2019t try back home.Visit sankash.in and finzy.comYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "In the battle of the biryanis, Arsalan\u2019s potato-laden version has its staunch supporters. And sandesh isn\u2019t the same unless it is from Balaram Mullick. The argument over who invented rosogolla can be solved over a couple of the sugar-soaked chhena dumplings \u2014 we can conclude that it simply doesn\u2019t matter. With Durga Puja around the corner, Bengalis around the country don\u2019t have to travel all the way to Kolkata to sample these signature dishes. JustMyRoots (JMR), a food-tech platform, offers to bridge the gap by shipping speciality dishes from iconic restaurants to 21 cities across the country. CEO and founder Samiran Sengupta says the idea is to tap into the nostalgia that India\u2019s largely migrant population have for the food of their hometown. Apart from the sweets, savouries and cooked dishes, their offerings include fresh fish like hilsa and produce like gondhoraj lebu. The platform has also partnered with restaurants in Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai and Lucknow, with plans to expand to Chennai, Hyderabad and Kochi, among other cities, by the end of the year.The concept is simple: visit the website or app and order like you would on a food-delivery platform like Swiggy or Zomato. The only difference is that you have to wait a few days before it reaches you. However, Sengupta reiterates that the food reaches their customer within 24 hours of being prepared. Another option that JMR offers is Direct From Home. \u201cThis is a big hit with parents whose children stay in different cities. They can ship a home-cooked meal to their child for special occasions, or simply because they are missing home,\u201d he explains. The food is picked up and packed much like it is from their restaurant partners, and delivered within the same time period. Their other USP is the packaging, he says. Although other sites like PlaceOfOrigin.in ship sweets, snacks, dry fruits, namkeen, pickles, jams, tea and coffee, the fact that JMR deals with freshly-cooked dishes, put the focus on the supply chain. \u201cWe spent nine months to a year just perfecting the packaging based on both customer and partner restaurant feedback. We finally settled on a product from Israel, which maintains the temperature of the food between five and eight degree Celsius, which is ideal for transportation,\u2019\u2019 he says. Customers will have to heat the food before consuming, as it will be maintained at this optimal temperature while it is being shipped. Future plans include expanding to China and other South East Asian countries by the end of this year, or early 2020, to cater to the Indian Diaspora population. It is also close enough to fulfill their 24 hour promise.

        " Facing the flak for letting contractors record and listen users\u2019 conversations via Google Assistant, the tech giant has announced to make some key changes in the way it records and reviews voice recordings.Google Assistant users will now need to confirm if they want to be part of the Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) process, which stores and reviews conversations.\u201cTo store your audio data, you can opt in to the Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) setting when you set up your Assistant,\u201d Google said in a statement late Monday.\u201cOpting in to VAA helps the Assistant better recognise your voice over time, and also helps improve the Assistant for everyone by allowing us to use small samples of audio to understand more languages and accents,\u201d the company added.You can view your past interactions with the Assistant, and delete any of these interactions at any time.\u201cIf you\u2019re an existing Assistant user, you\u2019ll have the option to review your VAA setting and confirm your preference before any human review process resumes,\u201d said Google.Google is updating its settings to highlight that when users turn on VAA, human reviewers may listen to your audio snippets to help improve speech technology.\u201cWe won\u2019t include your audio in the human review process unless you\u2019ve re-confirmed your VAA setting as on,\u201d the tech giant mentioned.Google last month stopped listening and transcribing Google Assistant recordings in Europe after Germany\u2019s data protection commissioner said the country was investigating reports that third-party contractors listened to users\u2019 bedroom talks captured by Google\u2019s AI-powered Assistant.Belgian broadcaster VRT NWS had reported that users\u2019 conversations with Google Home speakers were being recorded and audio clips were being sent to sub-contractors who then \u201ctranscribed the audio files for subsequent use in improving Google\u2019s speech recognition technology\u201d, raising serious privacy concerns.According to Google, audio snippets are never associated with any user accounts and language experts only listen to a small set of queries (around 0.2% of all user audio snippets), only from users with VAA turned on.\u201cFor those of you who have opted in to VAA, we will soon automatically delete the vast majority of audio data associated with your account that\u2019s older than a few months. This new policy will be coming to VAA later this year,\u201d it noted.VRT NWS, with the help of a whistleblower, was able to listen to more than 1,000 excerpts recorded via Google Assistant.The transcribers heard just everything: personal information, bedroom talks and domestic violence via Google Assistant in Belgium and the Netherlands.VRT \u201coverheard countless men searching for porn, arguments between spouses, and even one case in which a woman seemed to be in an emergency situation\u201d.Google said there will be additional security protection and additional privacy filters for Google Assistant in the near future.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        " Facebook on Monday said it had made a deal to buy a startup working on ways to command computers or other devices using thought instead of taps, swipes, or keystrokes.CTRL-labs will become part of Facebook Reality Labs with an aim at perfecting the technology and getting it into consumer products, according to Andrew Bosworth, vice president of augmented and virtual reality at the California-based social network.\u201cWe know there are more natural, intuitive ways to interact with devices and technology,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said in a post at Facebook announcing the acquisition.\u201cAnd we want to build them. The vision for this work is a wristband that lets people control their devices as a natural extension of movement.\u201dMr. Bosworth explained that the wristband will decode electrical impulses such as those sent to hand muscles telling them to move certain ways, such as clicking a computer mouse or pressing a button.The wristband will translate impulses into signals a device can comprehend, having thoughts rather than mouse clicks or button presses prompt actions on computers, according to Facebook.\u201cIt captures your intention so you can share a photo with a friend using an imperceptible movement or just by, well, intending to,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.\u201cTechnology like this has the potential to open up new creative possibilities and reimagine 19th century inventions in a 21st century world.\u201dHe spoke of how thought-commanded interactions might dramatically alter how people experience augmented or virtual reality scenarios, which currently feature hand-held controls.Facebook did not disclose financial terms of the deal to buy New York-based CTRL-labs, but unconfirmed media reports said it paid more than $500 million.After Facebook bought virtual-reality gear startup Oculus in early 2014 in a deal valued at $2 billion, social network co-founder and chief Mark Zuckerberg heralded the technology as the next major computing platform.Oculus has since built a line of virtual reality gear, pushing down the price and eliminating the need to be plugged in to a computer with its Quest VR headset.In Early 2017, Facebook announced projects aimed at allowing users to use their minds to type messages or their skin to hear words.The projects were the focus of a team of scientists, engineers, and system integrators with a goal of \u201ccreating a system capable of typing 100 words-per-minute straight from your brain,\u201d Facebook said at the time.Such brain-computer interface technology currently involves implanting electrodes, but Facebook wanted to use sensors that could be worn to eliminate the need to surgically intrude on the brain.Such technology could for example let people fire off text messages or emails by thinking, instead of needing to interrupt what they are doing to use smartphone touchscreens.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "couldnt find the paragraph",
        "Avalanche Studios\u2019 first-person-shooter game, Rage 2 (released in May), with its maniacal bluster, deflated our expectations faster than a balloon pricked at a child\u2019s birthday party. 2K Games\u2019 Borderlands 3, hence, was expected to give us a much-needed fix of carnage and loot. Squarely falling under a sub-category of gaming called shlooters, the Borderlands series has prided itself over its abundance of loot, especially with Borderlands 2 providing, as it tagline claimed, a \u2018Bazillion\u2019 guns. After a disappointing Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 3 comes to us with more guns.The MacGuffin in the Borderlands series has always been a mythical vault on the planet Pandora, which is rumoured to have alien technology. It prompts widespread carnage as corporations and cults engage in an arms race and devastate the planet. With news that there are multiple vaults buried all over the planet, the various factions unite under one banner known as Children of the Vault, led by the Calypso twins, Troy and Tyreen Calypso.BorderlandsThe success of Diablo has spawned a number of games as well as genres \u2014 from rogue-likes to hub-based online games. But the biggest takeaway from Blizzard\u2019s hit RPG has been the call of loot. Borderlands is one such game which rose to fame, using the same loot formula to build a fun, first-person-shooter set in a Wild West meets Mad Max science-fiction realm. With its razor-sharp dark humour, it has bravely taken on the industry with extreme success. Despite its flaws, Borderlands 3 is a commercial success, which goes to show Gearbox that their formula works.You play as one of the four vault hunters, Amara, a being of immense power and one of the six Sirens who can manifest multiple arms like an Indian goddess. Then there is FL4K, a robotic beastmaster who controls three pets. Moze is always accompanied by her 10-ton mecha and, as a gunner class, she is proficient with lots of guns. Zane is an operative that specialises in stealth, sabotage and espionage. The characters are fun and have their own styles. So you need to figure out what you want from this game before you choose.The same tongue-in-cheek humour is back and is there throughout the game, from the return of Claptrap, the robot mascot of the game, to the talkative bad guys. Borderlands 2 set the bar high, in terms of antagonists, with Handsome Jack, the ruthless head of the Hyperion Corporation. The Calypsos aren\u2019t as menacing. Thankfully, the game is filled with stuff to shoot \u2014 the machine guns matter more than the narrative in this case. Borderlands 3 Developer: Gearbox SoftwarePublisher: 2K Games Price: \u20b93999 for PC, Xbox One, PS4With your Gatling gun, grenade-launching mech and other mystical arms, you can cause large-scale devastation. The guns themselves are the stars of the show \u2014 the Wild West-themed ones, slick futuristic ones, ones with mounted shields or automated legs and more. You also get guns that burn and freeze your enemies as you scream maniacally.The game\u2019s quests send you mindlessly ricocheting around the map, across several planets, as an excuse to shoot as you gather points, skills and advance to further levels. But the game makes you grind to progress, and it doesn\u2019t help that enemies are bullet sponges, absorbing magazine after magazine before they go down. Hopefully, the makers fix this in the future.To some extent, it feels like you\u2019re living in a cartoon, thanks to the signature cell-shaded style of Borderlands, which looks the same as previous games. If you want a game to breeze through, this is the one for you. With excellent shooter mechanics, lots of loot, and more powers, Borderlands got the update it needed.

        "\nThis Sept. 12, 2018, file photo shows an Apple iPhone XR on display at the Steve Jobs Theater.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Apple is expected to unveil three new iPhone models that are so similar to last year\u2019s lineup, they may be upstaged by details about the company\u2019s upcoming video service. The company will show off its latest iPhones on Tuesday at an annual hardware showcase. But the buzz surrounding its best-selling products has waned, as have sales, in the absence of compelling new features.IPhone shipments are down 25% so far this year, according to the research firm IDC, putting more pressure on Apple to generate revenue from services such as music streaming, product repairs, revenue sharing from apps and ad commissions from making Google the default search engine. Revenue from services rose 14% to nearly $23 billion during the first half of this year. And now Apple is getting ready to roll out a Netflix-like video service that will feature a slate of original programs featuring stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Jason Momoa. Apple provided a peek in March, but hasn\u2019t specified when it will debut this fall or how much it will cost. Those details are expected to be revealed Tuesday, along with more information about a video gaming service called Arcade. The company\u2019s new phone models will likely mirror last year\u2019s iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max. Prices are likely to stay at $750 to $1,100, before add-ons such as more storage. And they will likely have the same design \u2014 with more display space, less bezel and no home button \u2014 that Apple switched to with the iPhone X in 2017. With little change, many customers who bought models in the past two years may hold off upgrading this year, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights said. The biggest difference is likely to be in the phone\u2019s camera, an area that Apple and its rivals have all been trying to improve as consumers snap more pictures on their devices. Even there, improvements from year to year have been small. This year, Apple is expected to add an extra camera lens to each model. The two pricier models already have a telephoto lens for better zoom. Now, they are expected to sport a wide-angle lens to capture more of a scene than regular shots. The cheapest model is expected to get one of those features, but it\u2019s not clear which. Even with those additions, the new iPhones may still be catching up with the improvements that rivals such as Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo and Google have been making to their latest phones. Unlike some of the other devices coming out this year, the new iPhones aren\u2019t expected to support upcoming ultrafast cellular networks known as 5G. Apple paid billions of dollars to settle a royalty dispute with chipmaker Qualcomm in April to gain the technology it needs for 5G iPhones, but those models aren\u2019t expected to be ready until next year. Besides iPhones, Apple is also expected to provide looks at the next versions of its internet-connected watch and its video-streaming device, Apple TV. New iPads could also be in the mix.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

        "\nThe Big Tech giants that were once praised as engines of economic growth with massive efficiencies have increasingly come under fire for allegedly misusing their clout in the market and lapses such as privacy breaches. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP  Attorneys-General of 50 U.S. States and territories announced on Monday that they were launching an investigation into Google\u2019s trade practices and whether they are threatening competition and harming consumers.\u201cThis is a company that dominates all aspects of advertising on the internet and searching on the internet,\u201d Texas AG Ken Paxton, who is leading the coalition, said on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, here in Washington DC, on Monday. He also made it clear that at present this was an investigation and not a lawsuit.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with a business becoming the biggest game in town if it does so through free market competition,\u201d Mr. Paxton said, adding that there is evidence that Google\u2019s business practices stifled competition, violated users\u2019 privacy , \u201c put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information\u201d and undermined consumer choice.Louisiana Attorney General, who was also present at the Court on Monday, said there was an \u201cabsolutely existential threat in our virtual marketplace\u201d. Alabama and California \u2013 the home of Google - have not joined the investigation, while Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have joined 48 states in the investigating coalition.Regulators have turned up the heat on big technology companies and the Google probe is but the latest sign of this. New York will lead a group of eight States and the District of Columbia in investing whether Facebook \u201cstifled competition and put users at risk\u201d, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced last Friday. The big four \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 are being scrutinised or subject to probes already between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the U.S.\u2019 trade regulator, and the Department of Justice (DoJ).The DOJ announced in late July that it is launching an investigation into \u201cwhether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power\u201d and have engaged in conduct that has stifled innovation.\u00a0You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "A research published six years ago by two Oxford academics, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, seemed to reinforce this ominous prediction about the global economy: Robots are going to take over our jobs. For, it warned that \u201cabout 47% of total US employment is at risk\u201d due to computerisation. Carl, this year, expanded the ideas of the research in a book, which is portentously titled, The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor, and Power in the Age of Automation. Contrary to what it seems, Carl, a genial Swedish-German economic historian, is neither a doomsday prophesier of technology nor a closet Luddite. He appreciates the long-term benefits of automation, and acknowledges the help of algorithms in his research. He says that the 47% from the research paper is misunderstood by many. For, he explains, the paper merely examines the possibility of automation and doesn\u2019t guarantee its outcome.MetroPlus met the economist during his visit to Bengaluru last week to discuss the rise of the robots, future job markets, among other things.Excerpts:Can automation \u2014 and the resultant loss of jobs \u2014 lead to social upheaval in a developing economy like India, which already has a large section of the population unemployed?If you look at the industrial revolution in Britain, for example, industrialisation caused a social upheaval, right? People petitioned the Parliament to block the introduction of new technologies, and they clashed with the British Army on several occasions. But I think the problem in India is that the manufacturing sector has failed to modernise. So it\u2019s become uncompetitive, which is even worse than having robots taking over jobs, because it means that instead of having some part of production being automated, you are essentially losing all of it. It\u2019s also one of the reasons why automation was allowed to progress in the United States. The labour unions understood that if production isn\u2019t automated, it may move abroad.How should governments of the present and the future prepare to deal with disruptions due to automation?I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single policy that can solve the situation. One part is managing the transition from the rural countryside to big cities. One thing we know about these new industries is that they tend to be highly clustered in cities like Bengaluru. And I think that process is only going to continue, and there\u2019s a sense that the countryside is being left behind. So, I think that you need to invest a lot in education and schooling, to make sure that people in the countryside have an opportunity to take on jobs that are emerging in the cities. You may have to incentivise people to actually move to the cities and help them financially in relocation. You need to invest a lot in public infrastructure and make sure that people can feasibly commute to work from the countryside. There also needs to be some form of reliable social security for people that are left behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nGP Sampath Kumar\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAn opinion poll by the Pew Research Center survey in 2017 found that 85% of US respondents favoured policies to restrict the rise of the robots. But do you think their rise is inevitable?No, I don\u2019t think so and history proves that. For millennia, growth was slow and stagnant because most people resisted technological change. There\u2019s always been a lot of groups that don\u2019t have an interest in new technologies being adopted \u2014 that can sometimes be workers and even the governments themselves. For example, one of the reasons you don\u2019t have any railroads in Argentina is because the lorry union there is extremely strong, and they wouldn\u2019t benefit from the railroads.What are some of the major jobs that could become redundant?There are very few industries that are unexposed to automation. But the main industries that we think are very likely to see significant job displacement are transportation, logistics, loaded duty autonomous vehicles, and warehouses. And production is going to continue to be more automated. And we\u2019re also seeing it quite significantly in the retail sector.So, what kind of jobs will today\u2019s children be doing in the next 25 years or so?We need to be humble about predicting the job market of the future. If you go back to the 1900s and ask someone, \u2018What do you think your grandchildren are going to be?\u2019, they wouldn\u2019t have said software engineers or hot yoga instructors or travel agents. I think jobs involving creative skills and complex social interactions are going to be increasingly important. Also, it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9 now: data is going to be the new oil. So, if you want to work with new technologies, then knowing stats and machine learning will be helpful.Can you also mention some of the new jobs that will be created due to automation?We are already seeing some new jobs emerging, like big data architects, cloud service specialists, Android developers and more. There are jobs like Zumba instructors, beachbody coaches. Also, some jobs that have existed for a while \u2014 like sommeliers \u2014 are back in vogue now. Because as we grow richer, we demand more services.Is your job safe from automation?High risk (Above 90%): Telemarketers, data entry keyers, tellers, sports referees, tour guides and moreMedium risk (45-55%): Dental assistants, medical appliance technicians, commercial pilots, massage therapists, fire inspectors and moreLow risk (Below 10%): Mental health counsellors, physicians and surgeons, preschool teachers, anthropologists and archaeologists and more(Source: The Future of Employment, 2013)What kind of political changes do you expect to happen around the globe?In western economies, if you go back to the 60s and 70s, you see that high-income voters tend to vote for the right and low-income, working-class voters tend to vote for the left. In the beginning of the 80s, you see a shift, wherein the highly educated voters tend to opt for the political left, whereas high-income voters continue to support the right. And, that has left the working class politically disenfranchised. And, that is the anger that the populists are tapping into effectively. I think the political outcomes over the next few years, or even decades, will depend on whether the liberal parties can provide credible solutions for the challenges posed by automation.Can you mention some of the key positives that can result out of this automation surge?If you look at history, it has been overwhelmingly positive in terms of technological progress. If you look at Britain, for example, people don\u2019t work in coal mines, where they don\u2019t see daylight for weeks and explosions are part of everyday life. Most people now work in air-conditioned offices. We have an abundance of goods and services that were unimaginable 200 years ago, right? So, technology over the long run is an extremely positive thing, but it can create short-term disruptions. In an economy like India, you need to make sure that people have the feeling that they have some stake in long-term growth.Do you think technology can help the environmental issues we are facing now?Yes, technology can be a part of the solution. It\u2019s true that new industries are less carbon-intensive than the smokestack industries of the past. Dematerialisation has certainly been a plus to the environment. We need to shift towards renewable energy. We may even need to think about geo-engineering. You\u2019d said in an interview that our debates on technology haven\u2019t progressed much since the early 18th century. So, what are the questions we should be asking?I think it\u2019s more about asking if technological progress is welfare-improving or not? It makes society richer, but does it make everybody better off? If significant groups in the labour market lose out, they can potentially opt against it. Therefore, we need policies in place to manage the short-term effects. And, there\u2019s always been this very polarised debate where it\u2019s either \u2018technology is wonderful; it\u2019s the solution to everything\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s dystopia\u2019. I think we need to see technology for what it is: which is, it\u2019s a good thing, but not necessarily good for everyone in the short run.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "Not on many occasions, I suppose, does a smartphone aid in self-reflection. In this regard, the Aura Glow version of Samsung Note 10+ is somewhat a historical device. A few moments after unboxing it, I was staring at my reflection while checking its back, which bears a striking resemblance to the shiny surface of the late compact disc. You will get the design if you are a fan of flamboyance in fashion. If you aren\u2019t one, like me, you will just ask, to no one in particular, \u2018why?\u2019If you overlook the garish back, a few other annoyances (like the deprivation of the 3.5mm earphone jack) and the hefty price tag (costs \u20b979,999), the Note 10+ is an efficient, easy-to-carry smartphone (weighs 196 grams).With the Aura Glow version of the Note 10+, the first thing that would catch your attention is its look \u2014 whether you like it or not is a different matter. The front of it is sleek and smooth with a notch-less, almost bezel-less Dynamic AMOLED display \u2014 the front camera, like a bindi, is placed in the centre. The front and rear glass panels and the phone\u2019s metal coalesce into one shimmering device that feels slick when held.The back is where the problem is. Well, the bling, of course, is a matter of taste. But even if you like the reflective surface, it will soon be smeared by fingerprints \u2014 which can easily mar the experience. \u2018Will I protect the phone from staining by covering it (and, thereby, diminishing its original beauty) or let it remain uncovered (and oversee the finger-smudges)?\u2019 is a question that requires some contemplation.The Cinematic Infinity Display can achieve peak brightness of up to 1200 nits \u2014 even under a sunny noon sky, I could read a news article with ease. The images, whilst watching a video, appear rich as well. With AKG\u2019s stereo speakers accentuated by Dolby Atmos, binging on TV shows is fun (the earphones that came with the device kept coming off my ears though). SpecificationsDISPLAY: 6.8-inch Quad HD+, Dynamic AMOLED Infinity-O Display, 3040\u00d71440 (498ppi), HDR10+ CertifiedCAMERAS: REAR: Quad Camera, Ultra Wide: 16MP F2.2 (123\u00b0), Wide-angle: 12MP 2PD AF F1.5/F2.4 OIS (77\u00b0), Telephoto: 12MP F2.1 OIS (45\u00b0), DepthVision Camera: VGA; FRONT: 10MP 2PD AF F2.2 (80\u00b0)BODY: 77.2 x 162.3 x 7.9mm, 196g, (BLE S Pen: 5.8 \u00d7 4.35 \u00d7 105.08 3.04g)BATTERY: 4,300mAh; Super Fast Charging compatible on wired with QC2.0, AFC and PD3.0; Wireless charging speeds with Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 compatible with WPC and PMAAUTHENTICATION: Lock Type: Pattern, PIN, Password; Biometric Lock Types: Fingerprint sensor, Face recognitionThe S-Pen, perhaps the most distinct accessory that comes with the Note series, is slightly more than just a gimmicky stylus this time. It is stubbier than its predecessors, which makes it easier to hold. The note-taking and doodling apart, it is helpful in clicking selfies, adjusting volume, navigating through gallery, among other things.Of course, these are mundane functions, but in order to perform them with the S-Pen, you need to make swishes and flicks much like what the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry do with their magic wands. But these movements aren\u2019t easy to master \u2014 you\u2019d rather use your fingers to change the camera mode than use the S-Pen and end up producing 10 weird selfies.Samsung has also improved its DeX feature that lets you use its Android apps on your computer screens with the help of just a USB Type-C to HDMI cable. To do the same in the Galaxy S8 version, you need a DeX station that costs over \u20b98,000. DeX is handy but far from completion, as many apps don\u2019t support this feature.When it comes to the Note10+ camera, there isn\u2019t a drastic change from Galaxy S10. And, that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it is already among the best smartphone cameras. The triple camera set-up (16MP ultrawide+12MP wide-angle+12MP telephoto) with DepthVision is adequate even for a serious photographer. There is a host of camera modes \u2014 hyperlapse, super slow mo, night, food and more \u2014 that makes it easy even for novices to click and record decent photos and videos. The live video mode, for instance, blurs the background of the subject, creating a bokeh effect \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work all the time, but when used right, produces cool outcomes.The AR Doodles and emojis allow you to fiddle around if you want to indulge in drawing moustaches or make funny faces. The doodles on the face will follow the face as it moves, even while recording videos. You can also record yourself doodling, if you press the record button before you begin to draw.For its weight, the Note 10+ packs a big battery \u2014 in fact the 4,300mAh cell is more powerful than its younger sibling the Note 10, and is the most resilient in the Note series. If you aren\u2019t into constant heavy-duty gaming, the phone will easily last over a day after a charge. And, of course, if you want to quickly do your hair, you can always turn your phone around to use it as a makeshift mini-mirror.The Note 10+ could have topped my list of the best smartphone releases this year but it loses out by a small margin to the smoother, sleeker and significantly more inexpensive OnePlus 7 Pro.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

But he follows only one account: Justin Bieber. What\u2019s so special about the pop singer? \u201cFrom what God told me, he only follows close family members. That\u2019s all I could get out of him,\u201d answers David Javerbaum, who runs the hugely popular @TheTweetOfGod account. While the snarky content is mostly aimed at American politics, climate change deniers and the general state of the world, a recent tweet brought up India. \u201cJust so you don\u2019t think I\u2019m totally obsessed with America, #RIPSushmaSwaraj.

Speaking from Los Angeles a week after this exchange, Javerbaum keeps up with the act that he isn\u2019t God, but merely works with/for him. I play along.Everyone knows how God created man, but what is the tale behind the genesis of his Twitter account? \u201cHe said \u2018I want to communicate with people and need someone funny to help punch up my jokes\u2019. He knew I was one of his chosen people, which helped,\u201d explains Javerbaum. Back in 2010, they began working on a book \u2014 The Last Testament: A Memoir by God. \u201cWorking with God, it was easy to get a publishing deal with Simon and Schuster,\u201d he says. His editor pointed him to Twitter, which was just gaining popularity, and the account caught on. \u201cI guess God and I were pretty good at it,\u201d he looks back. \n\nTHE FIVE STAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE1.

Drowning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the book eventually came out in 2011, people thought it was derivative of the Twitter account, though it wasn\u2019t quite so. Nevertheless, Javerbaum is very proud of it: \u201cIt\u2019s God looking back at the Bible and the New Testament and a lot of other aspects of human life. I would take a little less Twitter popularity for a little more book sales!\u201d Meanwhile, the online popularity made tweeting addictive for him. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to stop\u2026 The likes and the re-tweets going up and up, and it gets your pheromones going,\u201d he says.A few years later, he was approached by a Broadway producer about turning the account into a stage play. The Act of God played on Broadway for two consecutive summers, and went all over the world. It is yet to be performed in India, and he would love for that to happen some day soon. He is also on the verge of expanding into two other areas of entertainment. \u201cI may have a couple of cool things to announce soon,\u201d he says. \n\nAt those darkest moments when it feels like I've abandoned you, remember: I was never with you to begin with.\u2014 God (@TheTweetOfGod) July 13, 2019 \n\n\n\u00a0At those darkest moments when it feels like I've abandoned you, remember: I was never with you to begin with.God tweets and sometimes re-tweets others with comments, but doesn\u2019t engage so much in arguments, discussions, conversations. Can followers elicit a quick-witted reaction? \u201cGod replies to tweets exactly as often as he replies to prayers from other people,\u201d comes another quick response.Javerbaum lets us in on the secret that through this Twitter account, God is desperate to get into the Indian market \u2014 \u201cthe 33 crore gods are calling to him.\u201d What explains this knowledge of our politics, personalities and celebrities? \u201cIt\u2019s the largest market other than China. But China has no Twitter, and even God doesn\u2019t understand Chinese,\u201d says Javerbaum, who is yet to visit the subcontinent. \n\nI send natural disasters to punish mankind for being stupid enough to believe in a God who would send natural disasters to punish it.\u2014 God (@TheTweetOfGod) July 9, 2019 \n\n\n\u00a0I send natural disasters to punish mankind for being stupid enough to believe in a God who would send natural disasters to punish it.There has been a flip side to the success. Five years ago, the account was hacked, after which Javerbaum quit for a year and a half. Many have been offended, but \u201cnot as many as [I] would have wanted\u201d. Twitter itself has suspended his account twice. First, for a tweet that was mistakenly thought of as anti-gay, whereas it was anything but. Second was with a genuine reason: the background picture in his account had a blue tick despite his own account remaining resolutely unverified. \u201cIt\u2019s a Twitter trademark that can\u2019t be used without permission.\u201d Even by God, who supposedly should need no validation.Ask why there is an irreverent, at times cynical, view of the government, religion, institutions and also climate change, and he counters, \u201cI won\u2019t say \u2018at times\u2019. It\u2019s always cynical.\u201d Do Donald Trump in the US and many of his ilk provide him ample material? \u201cThe only time there would be no material for satire will be in a perfect world. And I don\u2019t see that coming any time soon. I do think that if it were a perfect world, my [in]ability to make fun of it would be a small price to pay,\u201d he says.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Using social media to help his mother\u2019s business grow became his best idea yet. Today, the family gets orders from as far as the U.S.According to Shubho Sengupta, Delhi-based digital marketing specialist, content is heading out of the cities. \u201cLook at the Skill India account on TikTok,\u201d says Sengupta. The most popular videos are of the underdog achieving greatness: for instance, welder Sachin Narale who went from a poor family in Soradi, Maharashtra, to the international stage; or Rohim Momin, a bricklayer from Khaltipur, Bengal, who won international awards. ShareChat, in fact, is not available in English at all, but has 15 Indian languages to choose from.Younger the betterNot only are SMIs now emerging from small-town India, but they are also getting younger by the day. All of 24, Sejal Kumar has 1.1 million YouTube subscribers and over six lakh followers on Instagram. When I call her, she first wants to know what the story is about, how long it will be, and whether her picture will be used. To the pre-social-media generation, this might sound narcissistic, but for Kumar, it\u2019s just business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSejal Kumar \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fashion and lifestyle SMI juggles time ideating, creating content, talking to fans, and negotiating with brands. She employs a team of four, and recently moved from Delhi to Mumbai. \u201cWe\u2019re the new-age stars,\u201d she says, seeing herself on a par with Bollywood celebrities a few years on. Sure enough, the economics graduate won 2019 Instagrammer of the Year (for fashion) along with Priyanka Chopra and Virat Kohli.These 20-something SMIs are bagging the biggest brands, ranging from Pizza Hut and Dairy Milk to BMW and Myntra. For Shivesh Bhatia, 23, with 1.8 lakh followers on Instagram, or Ranveer Allahbadia, 26, with 2.2 million followers on YouTube, their very first profession has been that of \u2018influencer\u2019. They are unfazed by social media\u2019s rapidly evolving landscape \u2014 from blogs to Facebook to YouTube to Instagram to TikTok and ShareChat. SMIs keep up, simply shrinking the size of their content accordingly.Faisal Khan, 31, who has over 7 lakh subscribers on his YouTube channel MotorBeam, and has worked with Apollo Tyres, Tommy Hilfiger, ICICI Bank, OnePlus, and more, gives the example of a 15-second video he shot for TikTok that had him opening the door of a Volvo and sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, followed by a shot of the car refrigerator and a couple of champagne flutes. \u201cIt has crossed 5.5 million views,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaisal Khan \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion makersThis cocky young breed is replacing traditional marketing channels to an extent where phone brand Oppo India\u2019s vice-president of product and marketing, Sumit Walia, calls them \u2018key opinion leaders\u2019. In fact, when Jo Malone, a U.K.-based luxury brand, invited people for a meet and greet in the capital, the smattering of traditional journalists had to wait for over an hour-and-a-half because the all-important SMIs had not arrived.Just as cheap smartphones and Jio\u2019s launch in 2016 created a generation of WhatsApp university graduates, it has also created a kind of young influencer who bargains for freebies, turns up late, and is often clueless about the products they work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkanksha Redhu \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Saumyaa Vohra, lifestyle editor at GQ, says, only a few have knowledge and experience. \u201cIf they have a fashion vlog, it only works if they have studied fashion or worked in a fashion magazine for some years. It\u2019s not just about putting up pretty pics and chasing likes and followers.\u201d Many new young SMIs, she says, \u201care exhausting\u201d. Manjira Dutta, co-founder of Don\u2019t Be Content, a content company, agrees. \u201cBarring a few, most of them don\u2019t understand much,\u201d says Dutta. \u201cWe write the copy, we check the copy, and we tell them how and when to post.\u201dMonetising viewsNone of which is impacting the SMI\u2019s earnings. A single Instagram post could fetch up to \u20b91.2 lakh, while a YouTube video earns up to \u20b910 lakh.With YouTube demanding TV-like quality, most influencers on this platform have a team that can be up to 30 people. Instagrammers employ freelance photographers and videographers. All of this is done to ensure followers because that\u2019s what attracts the big brands. Platforms like YouTube monetise views to run content-specific ads on the channel, so more views, more money. Even on platforms that are not led by revenue-per-click, brands still pick SMIs based on the number of followers.The frenzy for followers leads to fraud. Swedish e-commerce firm A Good Company and data analytics company HypeAuditor studied millions of Instagram accounts across 82 countries and found that India is No. 3 in the number of fake SMIs (the U.S. and Brazil are No. 1 and 2). This means fake or bot followers.Growing pangsThis, however, doesn\u2019t bother Priyanka Gill, who heads Plixxo, a company that brings brands and SMIs together. She says it is part of how the industry is developing. According to her, this is a nascent stage, and brand managers allow for \u2018discrepancies\u2019 when they sign deals. Plixxo, for example, divides SMIs into Superstars, Super Bloggers, Bloggers, and Campus Ambassadors, with further sub-divisions according to platform. This helps brands pick the influencers they want. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFive reasons to unfollow Instagram influencers \n\n\n\n\nFive reasons to unfollow Instagram influencers Brands are also becoming wiser in the way they\u2019re using SMIs, says Gill, often engaging with them in ways other than just pushing products. For instance, an experienced influencer like Vasudha Rai (over 1.6 lakh followers on Instagram), the former beauty editor for Cosmopolitan and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, is sought after for talks and workshops, often ticketed. And Khan helps automobile companies with confidential brand research projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAneesh Bhasin \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stars, comedians, and cricketers are still the biggest SMIs, the democratisation of platforms has made the girl or guy next door, whether from big city or small town, brand ambassadors too. \u201cSocial media has opened up a space where everybody has the right to have a voice,\u201d says Vohra.Thus far, brands might have seen a jump in their social media following or a spike in sales immediately after an SMI, say, wears a particular dress. But there\u2019s no tool to measure their exact impact on return of investment or their long-term effectiveness. What is clear, however, is that they are far less expensive than celebrities. Plus, there\u2019s the \u2018accessibility\u2019 factor. As Sengupta says, \u201cWhen Shah Rukh Khan endorses an i10, we all know he\u2019s not driving it,\u201d but an SMI who endorses it could well be driving the car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnupriya\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore important, the way an SMI plugs the product doesn\u2019t seem transactional. They seem genuinely interested in the product and are seen to be having fun with it. Thus, when Oppo recently launched model Reno 2, it collaborated with Instagram for a campaign where users had to take creative pictures with the phone while making it seem entirely authentic. This is one reason why no SMI is \u2018perfect\u2019 \u2014 their skin has blemishes; their hair is not always perfectly set; they\u2019re comfortable wearing bikinis even if it means showing cellulite. In short, they can pretend to be a \u2018real\u2019 customer and brands cash in on this relatability.SMIs like Anupriya Kapur, Akanksha Redhu and Kalyan Karmakar, who have been doing this for a while now, know that their reach with brands is mainly due to their loyal followers, so 50-80% of the content they put out is non-branded. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMohit Sukhija \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, brands don\u2019t even have to pay for endorsements. Celebrities are encouraged to just pose with products they like. Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder of the Svami line of beverages and an SMI himself, talks of Google Pixel, a phone he endorses. \u201cThey give you the phone and pamper you, but they don\u2019t pay you,\u201d he says. In the same way, Bhasin sends across a case of Svami products to celebs. \u201cIf they post a picture, great. If they don\u2019t, they may serve it to guests, and that\u2019s still good for me.\u201dIt sounds like everyone knows what they are in for, but the real underbelly of social media influencing might just be emerging. Doctors, for instance, are getting on board with large fan followings. While the average SMI is quite obviously pushing a product, it is much harder to tell when doctors are simply doling out friendly advice or when they\u2019re plugging a \u2018friendly\u2019 brand.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nThe Samsung Galaxy Fold smartphone is seen during a media preview event in London, Tuesday April 16, 2019. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP   Samsung has decided to cancel all pre-orders of Galaxy Fold in the U.S., just ahead of its re-launch for buyers who signed on to purchase the device earlier this year.As per Samsung\u2019s email, the pre-orders have been cancelled in order to \u201censure that you have the best possible experience with this revolutionary new technology,\u201d and it notes that the company is rethinking the entire process, including purchasing, unboxing, and service for the Fold (although it doesn\u2019t offer details), the Verge reported on Thursday.The South Korean tech giant reportedly sent out emails to pre-order customers letting them know that their existing pre-orders, many of which were placed in April, have been cancelled. A Samsung representative reportedly highlighted the recently announced \u201cGalaxy Fold Premier Service\u201d that it will be offering for the Galaxy Fold \u2014 presumably part of the new sales process \u2014 and promised more details closer to launch, the report added.According to YouTuber M. Brandon Lee, who first made the email by Samsung public, the smartphone player is also throwing in a $250 credit for free to be redeemed on any product sold directly through its online store. That includes the Galaxy Fold, so in the end, if you decide to re-pre-order it, you\u2019ll get a nice discount for what is definitely one of the most expensive smartphones ever, according to GSMArena.Samsung on Thursday announced that its foldable smartphone will be available in South Korea on September 6 in two colours \u2014 cosmos black and space silver.After its launch in South Korea, the foldable device would also be available in other countries including the U.S., Britain, France and Germany.

        "\nThis undated product image provide by Facebook shows screenshots of Facebook Dating, a mobile-only matchmaking service. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP   Facebook is tackling a new frontier \u2014 love. Facebook Dating, a matchmaking service the company already offers in Brazil, Canada and 17 other countries, arrives in the U.S. on September 5. But after years of privacy missteps by the social network, will people trust it with their love lives? For a company that\u2019s also developing its own digital currency and dabbling in e-commerce, love is another step toward reaching into all aspects of human existence. Although many features resemble what other matchmaking services offer, Facebook\u2019s version promises to be different, just as Tinder did before it with its swipe action and Bumble with its female-first messaging. Your Facebook Dating profile will be separate from your main one, but it will tap existing features such as events and groups, as well as your network of friends to identify \u201csecret crushes\u201d. Facebook Dating, while being free to use and free of ads, can still help Facebook make money if it keeps people glued to its other services longer. That\u2019s if users can get over concerns about privacy. \u201cA feature on Facebook that people don\u2019t trust isn\u2019t going to be successful,\u201d said Rob Sherman, the company\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer. \u201cWe built in privacy from the ground up.\u201d Tell that to Seth Carter, 32, an engineer from Terre Haute, Indiana, who tried a host of dating apps ranging from Match to Bumble, Tinder and Christian Mingle prior to his current relationship. \u201cFacebook is here to make money and I get that,\u201d he said. But he worries that Facebook\u2019s stated commitment to privacy would ultimately buckle under pressure to make money off the service. \u201cThat likely means they\u2019re going to sell my dating preferences, which means even more intrusions into my life.\u201d Facebook says it won\u2019t be doing any of that. But users like Mr. Carter can hardly be blamed for their apprehension, given the company\u2019s multiple stumbles over protecting people\u2019s private information. Facebook was fined a record $5 billion this summer by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations. It\u2019s also under scrutiny for allowing for the spread of election-related misinformation and discrimination in U.S. housing ads. Facebook Dating comes as the popularity of online dating grows \u2014 In 2016, 15% of all U.S. adults said they had used online dating services, up from virtually none in 2005, according to the Pew Research Center. From old school sites like eHarmony to Hinge or The League, a members-only service promising to bring together folks with \u201cambition and a drive to succeed,\u201d there are also apps focused on farmers, religious groups, seniors, the LGBT community and so on. When he announced the feature in 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook Dating is \u201cnot just for hookups\u201d but to build \u201cmeaningful, long-term relationships\u201d. That appeared to be a direct swipe at Tinder, a service best known for hooking people up with people they find attractive by showing their photo, age and first name. With Facebook, you start by creating a dating profile distinct from your Facebook profile. You can add up to 36 pictures from your Instagram account. You have to be at least 18, rather than 13 with the main Facebook service. When you see a suggested match, you \u201clike\u201d someone by tapping a heart icon, or tap \u201cX\u201d to dislike. There\u2019s no Tinder-like swipe. Facebook Dating won\u2019t suggest your friends as people you might want to date. Your dating profile also won\u2019t show up on your news feed or be visible to friends; it\u2019s only for others using the dating service. Facebook insists it won\u2019t use information gleaned from your dating profiles for advertising and says there won\u2019t be ads on Facebook Dating. To prevent unwanted messages, photos and spam, Facebook Dating lets you message someone just once unless you get a response. Facebook also won\u2019t allow lonely hearts or creeps to send photos or website links, which could help cut down on unsolicited body-part photos. There were initially rumblings that the dating feature might be open only to people who list themselves as \u201csingle\u201d and not those who are \u201cmarried\u201d or \u201cin a relationship.\u201d But Facebook has said this is not the case. After all, people often don\u2019t keep their relationship status up to date or don\u2019t use it in a serious way (in a complicated relationship with pizza, anyone?). To help you meet offline and share interests, the service will also push other Facebook features, such as events and groups. For instance, if you and a match are both going to a concert, you can make plans to meet up there. (These options require you to intentionally activate them.) You can also share your location with friends while on a date, a feature Facebook says has been popular in Colombia and Thailand. But based on Facebook\u2019s history with users\u2019 private information, there\u2019s certainly a possibility that it won\u2019t, so prepare to be embarrassed.

Ltd. on Thursday said its first foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Fold, will be available in South Korea from September 6 with fifth-generation (5G) mobile connectivity.The world\u2019s largest smartphone vendor said the device would be priced 2.398 million won ($1,977.47).The highly anticipated handset was originally due to hit the U.S. market in April but the launch was delayed by screen defects detected in samples.The firm said it would offer 5G and LTE-enabled versions of the Galaxy Fold in select countries including Britain, France, Germany and the United States. It did not provide release dates.Samsung has promised to usher in a new age of foldables as part of its effort to showcase innovation in a saturated smartphone market.The company announced in July it would be ready to sell the Galaxy Fold in September after making changes including strengthening hinges, which early reviewers had found to be problematic.Samsung will provide a program for Fold users in which the company covers 70% of cost of a display screen repair once within a year, according to its statement.\u201cConsumers have responded positively to larger screens, and the Galaxy Fold\u2019s revolutionary form factor offers a bigger, more immersive screen without sacrificing portability,\u201d said D.J.

        "If you are able to look away from Khaja Moinuddin\u2019s ear-to-ear grin, you will notice a 40 kilogram-capacity degcha or a handi that is either resting over a bed of embers or bubbling with food in the heat of a wood fire. His kitchen is always outdoors; Moinuddin is either cooking in the open under the sky or, during the summer months, under the shade of a tree. His smile remains intact, no matter where.Moinuddin\u2019s cooking is on a big scale, similar to his boundless smile. And if you are one of those who gets sucked into the web of cooking demo video feeds, then you are sure to have come across his.If Moinuddin\u2019s name doesn\u2019t strike a bell, the YouTube channel Nawab\u2019s Kitchen sure will. Popular as one of the viral content creators from Hyderabad, the chef is almost always cooking to be able to feed 40 people. The cooked food is distributed in orphanages and their staff, as well as among people who stop by and wait patiently to watch him cook.\u201cI always cook extra and never come back with leftovers. Once we are done cooking, everyone in and around the area where we cook is free to join us to eat. Initially we would pack the cooked food in boxes and distribute it, then we thought we would feel even better if we are able to serve the people directly,\u201d says Moinuddin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd who is the \u2018we\u2019 he is referring to? Moinuddin clarifies he might be the face of Nawab\u2019s Kitchen, but there are two others who work equally hard to put every video on YouTube. \u201cMy colleagues-turned-friends Srinath Reddy and Bhagat Reddy are with me in this. We conceptualised Nawab\u2019s Kitchen (NK) together,\u201d smiles Moinuddin.Moinuddin has over 10 years of working experience in regional TV channels as a producer. His friends and partners Srinath and Bhagat who prefer to work behind the scenes are experienced at working in the video editing department. Having known each other for a good number of years, the three decided to quit their jobs and start a YouTube channel that will engage, educate and be on a neutral topic like food. \u201cThere are very few people who don\u2019t pause while scrolling, to watch a video on how a certain dish is being cooked. Especially if it is an dish Indian, and been shot to show the richness of rustic regional cuisine,\u201d adds Moinuddin.NK\u2019s no-frill videos and a relaxed explanation of the ingredients and cooking process, wins him fans on his YouTube channel. His recipes are easy and simple to follow. \u201cHowever, we choose a venue to cook that is close to some orphanage so that we can share the food with them. When we set out to put together NK we wanted to do social service through what we were gaining,\u201d adds Moinuddin. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0None of the three friends are trained chefs, they function with the knowledge and experience that comes with observing their families cook. Moinuddin adds, \u201cMy nani was an excellent cook, when I was in Tenali with her while doing my graduation, I learnt her style of cooking.\u201dFor dishes like pizza and cakes, Moinuddin equips himself by learning online. \u201cWhen we reach the gates of the orphanages, the smile and love with which the children greets us, banishes the day\u2019s stress. The love and appreciation they show towards us makes us wonder where the children get their wisdom from,\u201d says Moinuddin. NK regularly visits about 15 orphanages to share their food.What is Nawab Kitchen\u2019s signature dish? \u201cMy mutton biryani has a lot of fans,\u201d he laughs.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nCosmos-Maya has positioned itself as one of the pioneers in the field of animation in India \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  A nine-year-old Ankush\u2019s life changes when he meets a mysterious character called Bajrangi, modelled after the Indian God Hanuman. Bajrangi not only helps Ankush deal with his inner fears, but also teaches him life lessons. This is the premise of the animated series Selfie with Bajrangi, whose quintessential \u2018Indianness\u2019 may look preposterous on paper, but has achieved popularity among children. The show runners are Cosmos-Maya, best known for creating the animated sitcom Motu Patlu, the Indian Laurel and Hardy.What started as a service studio in 1996 has grown into becoming one of the leading animators in the country. Since 2012, Cosmos-Maya became an Intellectual Property (IP) creation company with over 14 shows and 2,000-plus episodes. What explains the company\u2019s longevity? Over an email interview, Anish Mehta, CEO of Cosmos-Maya, attributes the success to the evolving business model. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnish Mehta, CEO of Cosmos-Maya \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFresh content is a great contributory factor here. Novelty and relatability are two aspects you will find in all our IPs. Our shows air in more than 150 countries worldwide. The latest and biggest evolutionary leap is our entry into third-party distribution, which we are aggressively pursuing.\u201d Secrets of an illusionistAnish Mehta believes that \u201cinternational co-productions are the way forward\u201d. Cosmos-Maya currently has four Italian co-productions including Leo Da Vinci, Berry Bees, an Italian-Australian-Irish co-production, OPS and Atchoo!.The company has tied up with Studio 100 France for the upcoming Galactic Agency.WowKidz, according to Anish, has registered over 12 billion views, giving us a picture about the company\u2019s digital penetration.From a business perspective, what determines the success of series like Selfie with Bajrangior Guddu? Is it the programming strategy or the numbers with which they gauge their target audience? The secret sauce, according to Anish, is \u201cthe ability to speak to viewers in the universal language of relatability\u201d. He goes on to add: \u201cIn a world where success is determined by rating points, I believe that success depends on the impact that the show leaves on the audience.\u201d In terms of the investment for an average animated series, Anish says that the scale is much lesser in India compared to other Asian markets like Korea and China. Without getting into actual numbers, he adds that the cost is anywhere between US$1.5- 2.5 million for 52 X 11 episodes.The Indian animation industry operates in a restricted environment (read: kid-friendly content) and the market is plagued by its need to cater to children \u2014 arguably the reason why we are light years away from producing a high-concept animated series like Netflix\u2019s BoJack Horseman, which has a reasonably good fan following among Indian millennials. Anish says that Cosmos-Maya has managed to identify this alarming gap and senses a potential opportunity, thanks to the influence of Hollywood movies, the opening of digital market and the audience\u2019s maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA still from Inspector Chingum\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several untapped markets in the country, he agrees. One such being cinema. Scores of independent VFX companies have been working closely with major studios in Hollywood. Yet, Indian cinema hasn\u2019t produced a single memorable animated feature which indicates the lack of fresh content in Indian cinema. It is also partly because the animation industry continues to depend on mythology for formidable narratives. In fact, Cosmos-Maya\u2019s feature film Motu Patlu: King of Kings did not do well unlike as opposed to its cartoon series. If this poses a threat to the animation industry, how do they overcome it? Anish says, \u201cStorytelling is evolving and Baahubali has proved it. It\u2019s a matter of time for animation to get there.\u201dCosmos-Maya gained a strong digital presence with WowKidz, an umbrella channel consisting of over 30 animated programmes with over 25 million subscriptions so far. Anish Mehta observes that there is a significant change in the consumption pattern of the audience, thanks to the emerging popularity of large-scale, video-on-demand services. With regards to the rising production quality on streaming services he elaborates, \u201cThis bodes well for content creators as there will be more touchpoints for the final consumer to reach our library... People are now more open to linear kind of stories and the length of the show is not that big a restriction.\u201dCosmos-Maya also has plans to exploit the potential of Virtual Reality, which is gradually seeping into the animation industry. But right now, Anish Mehta is optimistic about its future impact, \u201cWe will be foraying into VR soon. The business for VR in India is being analysed and the current trends paint a good picture.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\niNethra team members D. Neelima and K. Bhavya Sri with the prototype of the eye screening device at T-Hub on Monday.\n\u00a0 A team of four engineering students from a college affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad, has developed a device and mobile app to make vision screening easy, accessible and affordable too.iNethra, the product, comprises a handy, stick-like device with a lens on one end and connected to a smart phone camera on the other side. While this helps in clicking the retinal image of the patients, the mobile app helps in sharing and receiving information related to the eye condition. The clicked images are uploaded to the app for the doctor to access and analyse them. There is a provision in the app for the doctor to note details about the eye condition, provide tips and if required refer them to hospitals, said K. Bhavya Sri and D. Neelima, two members who received a certificate on behalf of the team for participating in 2019 national cohort of the Boeing University Innovation Leadership Development programme.The certificate, presented to them by IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan at an event in T-Hub on Monday, said they have successfully completed the regional level workshop held earlier this month at T-Hub Foundation. M. Srija and D. Sai Sowmya are the other members. Aiding them was J-Hub, the incubator at JNTU, by way of mentoring, shaping their idea and business plan and making connections with doctors, according to Ms. Bhavya Sri. On the way forward, Ms. Neelima said with the prototype in hand, the team looked forward to getting funds to take the project forward and simultaneously improvise the device and cut down the costs. Initially, the plan is to pursue a B2B (business-to-business) model under which partner eye clinics would approach patients coming to public health centres.Mr. Ranjan, who is also officiating as Vice-Chancellor of JNTU, told the Entrepreneurship Day celebrations at T-Hub how Hyderabad boasts of a strong start-up eco-system, including the high quality J-Hub incubator. The affiliated colleges of JNTU too have set up their own incubator and with J-Hub connected on a hub and spoke model. Tracing the growth of the \u201cvibrant and dynamic innovation eco-system\u201d of Hyderabad and the emergence of T-Hub, the senior official said a lot has changed including the mindset of people towards start-up and entrepreneurship. T-Hub CEO Ravi Narayan, founder of Thickshake Factory M. Yeshwant Nag, GrabOn founder Ashok Reddy and MapMyGenome founder Anu Acharya participated in a panel discussion.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "The researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H), have collaborated with research institutions across the world to develop a device to detect heart diseases in minutes. In a work published recently in the peer-reviewed Journal of Materials Chemistry B, they say their work not only promises diagnosis or prediction of heart disorders within minutes, but can also be extended to detection of other diseases.Headed by Renu John, head of Department of Biomedical Engineering, IIT-H, the research team says clinical complications of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are at present the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Primary and specialist health-providers use a variety of tools for clinical assessment of the existing heart diseases and to identify vulnerable patients at risk for CVD. Biosensors are one such tools. Prof. Renu John\u2019s studies on microfluidics would help in building biomarker-based biosensors that could be used for instantaneous detection of heart attack and other cardiac diseases.\u201cBiomarkers are biological molecules that represent health and disease states. They are specific chemicals that are released in the body in response to certain physiological conditions. Cardiac troponins or cTns, for instance, are biomarkers of heart diseases and are conventionally detected in the blood stream using antibodies that bind specifically to them. Biosensors are devices that combine the sensing element (the antibody) with a transducer that converts the interaction of antibody into electrical or optical signal that can be measured. Conventional biosensing includes such techniques as ELISA, chemiluminescent immunoassay and radioimmunoassay,\u201d said Prof. Renu John. B.D. Malhotra from Delhi Technological University said, \u201cThe major issue with the conventional assays for the detection of cTns relates to poor sensitivity and limitations in detection. Improvements in detecting biosensors such as cTns in blood require improvements in the design of the biosensor\u201d.Prof. Malhotra believes that the technique can be extended to other diseases as well by varying the type of biomarker/antibody that is attached to the nanospheres. Thus, microfluidics-based biosensing offers new opportunities in the areas of biological engineering, biomedical studies, point-of-care diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.Prof. Renu John\u2019s team and collaborators from IIT-Kanpur, Zoological Survey of India, Iowa State University and Delhi Technological University, used hollow nickel vanadate nanospheres, modified with chitosan and loaded with antibodies of cTns in a microfluidic set-up. When blood containing the CVD biomarker cTns passed through the biofluidic set-up loaded with biosensing nanospheres, cTns binds with the antibody and induces an electrical signal in the nanosphere, which is then detected.Prof. Renu John and his team tested the performance of the microfluidic biosensors using blood serum of cardiac patients and compared the results with those of conventional chemiluminescence assays. They found that the microfluidic devices could detect the CVD biomarker cTns with extremely high degree of accuracy and sensitivity. cTns levels as low as 0.000000000005 grams in one millilitre of blood could be detected, which makes this technique a useful tool for detection of cardiovascular maladies, they say.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "The Fire Emblem series is one of the finest turn-based strategy games. For ages, it has been living on Nintendo\u2019s 3DS handhelds. For the first time in 12 years, the series is coming to Nintendo Switch, a hybrid console. Fire Emblem can now be experienced in your living room and on the go. The latest game in the series, Three Houses, is very addictive. Fire Emblem Nintendo is famous for Mario and Donkey Kong, but they also have other franchises that are long running. Fire Emblem is one of them. It was only available in Japan for a long time. But the game has become increasingly popular in the west, as it offers deep storylines, turn-based strategy mechanics and some devious battles.The prestigious Church of Seiros is the only thing maintaining peace between three previously warring nations in the land of Fodlan. You play a mercenary named Byleth who saves three nobles, each a representative of a powerful house in the Officers Academy of Garreg Mach Monastery. After the heroic rescue, you find yourself becoming a teacher in the Academy, which has three houses (a la Harry Potter): the Black Eagles, the Golden Deer and the Blue Lions. As professor, apart from teaching, you also play the role of a commander, to lead your house to glory. The story, which explores the deadly politics (not Game of Thrones-level though) between the powerful nations, is intriguing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Emblem also has \u2018Permadeath\u2019, a feature that disables the character from respawning \u2014 if you die, you die. You could avoid this in the casual mode. Additionally, there\u2019s an undo feature, Divine Pulse, wherein you can rewind a few turns. Fire Emblem: Three Houses Developer: Intelligent Systems, Koei Tecmo GamesPublisher: Nintendo Price: \u20b94000 Approx ($59.99) for Nintendo SwitchThe turn-based strategy game is challenging, even if you discount permadeath. You control battalions on a map led by units and position them on a chessboard-like grid. Attacks play out in glorious detail on a 3D plane, once you unleash Combat Arts your students learn at the school. The most fun aspect of the game is the school social simulator, which reminds you of Hogwarts. As a teacher, the game consistently reminds you that slacking off will lead to untrained soldiers on the field. On Sundays in the game, you\u2019re free to relax in many ways, which includes romancing a character (it can lead to an in-game marriage). No matter how you choose to spend your days, it\u2019s always about building strong relationships with your students and training them to be the best. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you own a Nintendo Switch and want something deep to jump into, the Fire Emblem: Three Houses is excellent. With its Hogwarts-like setting and excellent turn-based combat, the game will keep you engaged.

        "So, you have posted your latest achievement on social media. Within minutes, your phone buzzes with notifications. You click immediately to excitedly see how many likes and retweets you have received... and now you\u2019re hooked. Social media addiction has become a \u2018second nature affliction\u2019 to most of us \u2014 so much so, that there are rehabilitation programmes for it. But what propels this addiction? As part of BBC\u2019s long-running Panorama specials, Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side is soon to be aired on Sony BBC Earth. It is hosted by journalist Hilary Andersson who gets to the bottom of this ongoing social dilemma. In a phone interview, the show\u2019s executive producer Diana Martin provides an insight into how habit-forming technologies have got us hooked onto our phones and what the implications are. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts:How did the idea for the show come about? We were interested in doing something more general on social media and smartphones because they have completely changed our behaviour in the last 20 years and a couple of us on the programme have also got children. Hilary and I are acutely aware how glued our children are to their phones and other devices.Social media always seems to be addictive, but we couldn\u2019t get an answer as to whether it was really addictive and what we should do about it as parents. So we set out researching the nature of our phones and apps that have changed our behaviour, and we wanted to ask whether the social media companies were aware of what they were doing.Are these habit-forming technologies deliberate? The techniques we looked at were the endless scrolling and the \u2018like\u2019 button. Scrolling wasn\u2019t always the case when social media first existed. When search engines first existed, you would get a page of results and then you would have to click to get to the second page. But now when you are scrolling, you don\u2019t have to click. And what we looked into was whether that made you keep reading more. These days, scrolling seems obvious, but is central to all social media.Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side shows how it is like having an endless bowl of soup. If you drink a bowl of soup, you get to the bottom of the bowl and you are finished. But if it is endless, then people would eat more and they would probably eat more than they need. And then, the \u2018like\u2019 button was invented. The \u2018like\u2019 button is now ubiquitous and is cluing into our human behaviour. If you get a \u2018like\u2019, you are more hooked onto it. We talked to Justin Rosenstein, who is the co-founder of Asana, who invented the \u2018like\u2019 button for Facebook. We spoke to psychologists who showed us how similar social media addiction was to what we see in casinos to encourage people to gamble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there anything we have lost permanently in terms of human interaction? Has it changed the way we make choices?  We were careful not to criticise smartphones or social media. We all have smartphones. They massively help us with our work and to communicate with our family and friends. However, the point here is there are advantages, but there are also disadvantages. Social media is potentially habit forming or addictive in nature. So we did a lot of work into asking whether they are addictive. Scientists were divided on this. Some said they are addictive, but some said they are not really addictive, but they are clearly habit forming. We are reporting the story as we saw it. What we hope to do is help viewers understand a bit more about the possible impact of social media and smartphones on their behaviour. They need to consider their approach and to be a bit more mindful next time they endlessly scroll or the next time they hit the \u2018like\u2019 button.What about the impact of social media on politicians and has it changed how we make political choices? There is a lot more to explore in that area. Clearly, politicians and political parties have had to respond to the rise of social media and different parties have responded in different ways and some have made a certain use of it than others. There is an interesting story on how authoritarian governments are using social media not just for election campaigns but also to control populations, and though the show isn\u2019t about that, I think it is a really interesting issue.What were the challenges in putting together \u2018Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side\u2019? It was very important for us to be impartial. We are the BBC and we have a duty towards impartiality. So the first thing is to make sure that we cover all sides of the argument. We spoke to various people who criticised the manipulation of social media companies. But we also made sure we spoke to people from Facebook who defended the position. And we spoke to a man who develops social media apps who maintained that social media is good for mental health and well-being. The second challenge is that we are not scientists, and it is an area where science hasn\u2019t really come to a comprehensive answer yet, and so we spoke to two psychologists, but there are other scientists who have other views. And it is early days. We had to reflect that as well so that we were not oversimplifying things.\u2018Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side\u2019 will premiere on Sony BBC Earth on August 31, at 9 pm.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nIf think you are seeing Tom Cruise, you are wrong. It's Bill Hader. \u00a0 The current viral sensation on the internet is a rather creepy video of Saturday Night Live\u2019s Bill Hader, whose face morphs into that of actors Tom Cruise and Seth Rogen even as he speaks.The video was published barely two weeks ago, but has garnered nearly 4.2 million views during that time, not to mention clips of the morphed video floating around on Twitter, Reddit and other social media sites. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Various morphed videos of actors exist, but why did this one go viral in particular?In the video, Hader recounts an incident in which he meets Cruise and Rogen, and every time he does an impression either of the two, Hader\u2019s face subtly shifts into theirs. The shift is smooth but the impact is so jarring that you can\u2019t help but wonder what sorcery this is.Fortunately, the internet has an answer. Unfortunately, it might not be an answer you\u2019d like.The Bill Hader video is an example of \u2018DeepFake\u2019, form of editing videos that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning.According to the Associated Press, deepfakes are made by feeding a computer an algorithm, or set of instructions, and lots of images and audio of a certain person. \u201cThe computer program learns how to mimic the person\u2019s facial expressions, mannerisms, voice and inflections. If you have enough video and audio of someone, you can combine a fake video of the person with a fake audio and get them to say anything you want,\u201d the news agency writes.This is not the first time deepfakes such as this one have gone viral. Earlier this year, another couple of Bill Hader videos became popular as well, this time with the actor doing impressions of Al Pacino and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Pacino video has 4.2 million views, and the Schwarzenegger video has 8.3 million views. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0These videos were all released by the same YouTube channel, Ctrl Shift Face.The channel\u2019s owner, and the creator of these videos, told The Guardian that \u201cunsettling face-swapping videos are an attempt to raise awareness in the age of fake news and footage.\u201dThe YouTube channel also has deepfake videos of Elon Musk in footage from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bruce Lee in place of Keanu Reeves in The Matrix, and more.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nRepresentational image. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n  Banking and finance, government and critical infrastructure were among the most targeted sectors in India by cybercriminals in 2018-19, according to tech major Cisco. Also, about 26% of these overall attacks cost organisations in the country upwards of $5 million each. \u201cThe hackers are persistent, and their campaigns are very targeted. We have found that sectors like banking and finance (20.1%), government (19.6%) and critical infrastructure (15.1%) were among those that continue to face the highest threat of cyberattacks,\u201d Cisco India and SAARC Director (Security Business) Vishak Raman told PTI. He added that cybercriminals are also increasingly targeting sectors like defence (15.1%), IT, telecom and healthcare. \u201cThey are using a host of mechanisms like point of sale attacks to target sectors like retail, hospitality, entertainment and e-commerce. Ransomware are used to attack public sector entities, transportation as well as banking and finance verticals,\u201d he said. Raman cited an Asia-Pacific Security Capabilities Benchmark Study conducted by Cisco that found 21% respondents saying cost of breach for them was between $5-9.9 million, while another 5% said it was more than $10 million for them. The cost of breach included loss of revenue, customers, and other costs related to the event. About 27% said the cost of less than $100,000 \u2014 an indication that while the amount involved may be small but the volume of such attacks is growing. \u201cCompanies are now spending on not just protection but also increasingly on proactive threat hunting, more forensics,\u201d he said.

        "\nSantosh Thottingal\n\u00a0 Until the middle of the past decade, typing Malayalam on the computer was not as easy as it is today. That was around the time when a group of technology and language enthusiasts got together under the banner of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing (SMC) with the aim of \u201cmy language for my computer\u201d.Within a few years, their efforts paid off, with the development of tools and fonts in the Unicode system, enabling a standardised Malayalam script in computers, which is now commonly used in everything from government orders to online newspapers to Internet memes.Santhosh Thottingal, a software engineer who played a key role in this transformation, has now been chosen for the Maharshi Badrayan Vyas Samman by the President in recognition of his contributions to Malayalam language. A principal software engineer with the language engineering team of Wikimedia Foundation, Mr. Thottingal is behind some of the most commonly used fonts like Manjari and Chilanka.\u201cI was active with the free software movement during my college days. The assumption then was that local languages are unsuitable for computers. That is when I came across the work done by a team of Indian Institute of Science (IISc) scientists to develop text-to-speech system for palm-held devices in Kannada. I tried to make something similar in Malayalam when I realised that we have to address the fundamental issues first \u2014 being able to type in a proper form in Malayalam. Our attempt through SMC was to build a foundation for Malayalam computing,\u201d he says.The technology for Malayalam fonts was much more complicated than for English. In Malayalam, the combined letters (Koottaksharam) and their shifting patterns had to be coded. He set aside his spare time for five years to perfect these.\u201cWe had to learn the core of Malayalam, how the language has been portrayed and the history of printing in Kerala. That is when we realised that the \u2018old Malayalam lipi\u2019 was much more scientific and beautiful. The \u2018new lipi\u2019 was developed around the 1980s, cutting down the number of letters and separating the combined letters, under the assumption that the old one could not be replicated on computers,\u201d he says.Following the work of SMC and the release of fonts in the \u2018old lipi\u2019, the Kerala government, in 2010, issued an order that all official communication online should shift to the old system. \u201cAll of our work is voluntary and does not generate any revenue, although this work did secure me a job with Wikimedia,\u201d says Santosh. Now he is about to finish an even more important project, to \u201cteach Malayalam grammar to the computer\u201d.\u201cNow, the computer understands Malayalam only as a sequence of bytes. It does not understand the language like it does English, which enables the working of devices like Alexa and Siri. For that, grammar has to be algorithmically represented and machine-translated. The work is almost over,\u201d he says.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

        "\nVersatile: The App can detect symptoms on any part of the crop and is trained to read even images of lower quality.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement  Identifying diseases and pests on banana crops will now be just a click away. Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system (AI) which can look at photographs and tell what disease the plant has and also give recommendations and treatment options to the farmers. The results showed that the model was over 90% accuracy.The neural network was given about 20,000 images showing diseased and healthy plants. \u201cJust like teaching a kid to tell an elephant from a horse, we taught the AI to identify leaf, root, fruit diseases and pests. Pictures from Uganda, Colombia, Congo and India were fed into the system for the training,\u201d says Dr. Sivalingam Elayabalan from the Department of Biotechnology, Imayam Institute of Agriculture and Technology (IIAT), Trichy, Tamil Nadu. He is one of the authors of the study published in Plant Methods.The tool is now incorporated into an App called Tumaini, meaning hope in Swahili, and being tested. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The team is planning to add more diseases based on regions and also make the App available in local languages. \u201cWhen users take the photo, it gets uploaded to a global system for large-scale monitoring. Also, it is automatically GPS-tagged so we know what and where the problem is. We are also planning to incorporate high-resolution satellite monitoring to check the health of large fields,\u201d explains Dr. Michael Gomez Selvaraj, from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia in an email to The Hindu. Dr. Selvaraj is the senior author of the paper. The App can detect symptoms on any part of the crop, and is even trained to read images of lower quality.The app is now being tested across many countries and when the confidence of 100% is reached it will be available for free download. \u201cYellow leaf spot and Fusarium wilt are the major fungal diseases in India and farmers spend a lot of money on fungicides. Apart from the fungal disease, the viral disease such as Banana Bunchy top virus is a big problem in hilly areas of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Northeast region. The App can tell the farmers in advance bringing down the treatment costs,\u201d says Dr. Elayabalan. \u201cWe are now testing the App in Tamil, and it will soon be available in Hindi and Malayalam. The National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) have shown interested in the App.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nA screenshot of the Number Neighbour Challenge which actor Chris Evans denied\n\u00a0 Here is the web\u2019s latest craze: the Number Neighbour Challenge. Raise your hand if you\u2019ve tried this frankly risky texting task in which you text the person one digit away from your mobile number and strike up a conversation. Could it be your next best friend? Or a serial killer? I guess you won\u2019t know until you try.But in true Internet fashion, there are some fakers out there, telling everyone their number neighbour is Chris Evans or Barack Obama. Please guys, Chris Evans is obviously busy running after Anthony Mackie with Captain America tips, and Obama is saving America from an orange with a toupee. Plus, I bet celebrities have numbers with Wingding-like characters so we can\u2019t even reach them.Anyway, what\u2019s the big deal with Number Neighbour Challenge? Simple: it\u2019s a fun version of roulette, which doesn\u2019t require you to leave the comfortable confines of your bed. (And, no, I didn\u2019t try it, my bed begged me to binge-watch the four different series.) Those who did try it, shared the screen-shots of the exchanges on their social media platforms. Some number neighbour experiences were filled with mutual excitement, while others were brimming with distrust and even straight-out hatred. Some were over-the-moon to find their new \u2018friends\u2019 had iMessage. The hashtags #NumberNeighbour and #NumberNeighbor have been trending for about a week-and-a-half, which is pretty solid for an online challenge. Well, that\u2019s what the right kind of intrigue gets.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Stuntin Like My Daddy\u2019 episode features Rue (Zendaya)\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nHBO\n HBO\u2019s Euphoria tackles addiction, self-exploration and other trials which come with growing up. Equally addictive is the show\u2019s cinematography. The first season just concluded but the visuals linger in your mind; picture jewel toned lights in low-lit rooms and a dizzying haze. Euphoria follows determined drug-user Rue (Zendaya) who returns from rehab with no intention of staying clean. She strikes up a friendship with fellow high-schooler Jules (Hunter Schafer) and we observe their shifting relationships with reality. Speaking with one of the show\u2019s cinematographers Marcell R\u00e9v he reveals he worked on four episodes out of the eight: the pilot, part of \u2018Stuntin\u2019 Like My Daddy,\u2019 \u2018Made You Look\u2019 and \u2018Shook One: Pt II\u2019 before moving on to other projects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinematographer Marcell R\u00e9v \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSandor Fegyverneky\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hungarian, who\u2019s currently in Europe shooting L\u00e9a Seydoux-starrer The Story Of My Wife, explains it was no easy journey to achieve the look and feel of the final result but the entirely collaborative process was truly a satisfying one. Excerpts:Can you talk about how you came to work on \u2018Euphoria\u2019?I had worked with Sam Levinson, the showrunner, writer and director for most of the episodes, on a film from the previous year Suki Waterhouse-starrer Assassination Nation (which premiered at Sundance Film Festival). When we finished that, he was already talking about Euphoria and we were trying to figure out how it would look and the world of Euphoria. He actually hadn\u2019t finished with the script yet, but he had an idea of what he was going for.Did you look to the original Israeli series by Ron Lesham for reference?I\u2019ll be completely honest, I haven\u2019t seen it! It was on purpose, I didn\u2019t want it to influence me and I think Sam wanted to change a lot of things; it\u2019s more like a personal work for him than an adaptation. HBO bought the license but I think the original had a completely different storyline and set of characters.What was your and Sam\u2019s collaborative process like during \u2018Euphoria\u2019?We started prep pretty early on and it\u2019s during those moments where you share ideas and images, books and other movies. These are long conversations. We narrowed it down to a reel of where your project is heading, seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t. Every time I work with Sam, I discover a lot about myself and about film-making too.Of course, we started to scout. Production designer (of four episodes) Michael Grasley was also involved pretty early. After the pilot we built most of the interiors on stage, so the three of us started to figure out the main sets of the show. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Made You Look\u2019 episode with Nate (Jacob Elordi)\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nHBO\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you balance the psychedelia and the realities of the world of these high schoolers? How did you finalise on the framing?We wanted to have something that was grounded in reality but, at the same time, as Sam phrased, wanted to give teenagers a show of what they imagine for themselves, how they would see themselves in a show. There is a lot of technical stuff you have to figure out in terms of cameras and lenses, lighting style, colours as well as the amount of haze or smoke, we had to plot how the camera would move, etc. So basically the visual language of the piece that consists of lot of small technical decisions. We wanted it to feel real but not in a way you would normally call realist, more like an emotional realism. That allows you to be a little more courageous in terms of style. You\u2019re telling the stories of these different characters (macho jock Nate, drug addict Rue, lost soul Cassie, sexually experimental Kat and more) whose lives all collide in this singular and messy world. Did their narratives drive any cinematography?We wanted to create a coherent world first as a main approach. In that same world, we dramatised each and every scene\u2026 not really by character because the production design was going by character, which came naturally. The rest is dramatising the scenes and helping with photographic ideas to make it more efficient. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Shook Ones Part II\u2019 episode with Rue (Zendaya) and Jules (Hunter Schafer) at the carnival\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nHBO\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe light (and sometimes absence of it) is a major element in these visuals, too! It keeps shifting, especially during these hazier parts. Was lighting controlled in real time?  Interestingly, in post-production, we didn\u2019t do a lot in that aspect. To get more technical, we had a lookup table (LUT), provided by the show\u2019s colorist Tom Poole, which we see on the set and it is used to determine the colours and contrast with which a particular scene or frame will be displayed in its final form. What we saw on set was pretty close to what ended up on the scene. So, yes, it was controlled on the set. That said, how experimental did you get with the cinematography? Was there something new you tried which you haven\u2019t done before?I\u2019m just trying to help directors create something they want and not push my own wild imagination [laughs] but I enjoy experimenting. Sam is someone who was really encouraging and pushing everyone to go as far as they can with their imagination, and I was also pushing him. It was a good force of experimentation.But this show only works when it\u2019s grounded in reality; we said to ourselves, \u2018we can allow ourselves everything within the emotional realm of the characters.\u2019 So if it\u2019s driven by an emotion, you can be really brave and we tried to be.I loved the music of \u2018Euphoria\u2019, all thanks to British musician Labrinth. In the show, the visuals, the sound and the music come together in this world. Did you stylise your work in that sense to suit the music?I love the music too! Sam and I were also kicking around ideas and listening to music. Some of them end up in the show, some don\u2019t. Plus Labrinth was working simultaneously while we were shooting, so sometimes while we would ride to set, we would be listening to all that in the car and it was inspiring. I wouldn\u2019t say we were designing or choreographing shots for the music except for the last episode which was done by Adam Newpart-Berra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Made You Look\u2019 episode. The still sees a split screen scene of Jules (Hunter Schafer) and Nate (Jacob Elordi)\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nHBO  \n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Adam and the other DoPs, how did you guys engage continuity between the episodes?  Most of it was led by Sam so most of the communication was between him and the DoPs. But mostly we set up in the first four episodes we\u2019d set up a world. Drew Daniels, Adam Newpart-Berra and Andr\u00e9 Chemetoff took it to another level and they did such a great job.Do you have any favourite scenes or episodes?Visually, I\u2019m really proud of episode four; the carnival episode \u2018Made You Look\u2019... it was a technically challenging and also rewarding episode. The split-screen sequence in episode three and also in that same episode the scene where Rue takes pictures of Jules in her room; it\u2019s a simple but deeply emotional and honest scene and Z and Hunter are just so good in it.Naturally there are emotionally difficult subject matters here. What did you observe in terms of the actors\u2019 approaches to these issues? Were you nervous prior to the show airing?The fact that the cast was this young made the topics more sensitive. But the actors were so mature and professional; I was so impressed. For any sexual subjects, HBO has an intimacy coordinator who\u2019s constantly present and helps communicate with the director and the actors. And when you talk about these issues in a profound and direct way, that\u2019s the best way to approach these subjects in a safe zone. I, like I guess everyone involved, was nervous before the show aired but now I\u2019m pretty happy with what it is. Of course there are people who don\u2019t agree with what I would call the subject matter of the show, but that\u2019s more like a political or ideological issue not a quality matter and it also proves its importance.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "If one came across a page called Humans Of Cinema, it\u2019d be fair to assume that there\u2019ll be a flurry of posts about film industry folks. But 23-year-old Harshit Bansal from Delhi took the idea beyond the predictable and caught netizens\u2019 attention in early May when he announced \u2018Mental Health Talks x Humans Of Cinema;\u2019 a project inviting film enthusiasts to talk about the moments in cinema which helped them through tough times. The series aims at highlighting the positive power of cinema. The link-up with Mental Health Talks India was serendipitous for Harshit. \u201cThe idea of correlating cinema with mental health came from a very personal space for me,\u201d he explains, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very personal relationship with films. But two years ago, when my mental health was at its worst, watching my favourite film or TV show used to make me feel better. I think films have the potential to evoke emotions and induce empathy like no other medium in the world, which is why it becomes such a powerful tool of self-help as well as rehabilitation for people. Eventually, however, it\u2019s important to remember that films are only a temporary medium of escape and professional help should be sought when necessary.\u201d The future of Humans Harshit considers the \u2018Humans Of..\u2019 concept to be one of the most important things to have happened to society in the last decade. \u201cThe Humans Of pages from around the world have successfully acted as flag-bearers of positivity and a feeling of unity in an otherwise negative social media and an increasingly polarising society. I think this shows that stories and experiences unite people and make them forget about their differences, and I hope these pages are able to keep doing that in the future as well. After all, even when everything is lost, it\u2019s the stories which survive.\u201dMental health narratives are prevalent in the series, through a sweet letter to Robin Williams\u2019 character John Keating in 1989\u2019s Dead Poets Society or Alia Bhatt\u2019s Ananya in 2014\u2019s 2 States. It\u2019s worth noting many film characters tap into the mental health space in one way or another. \u201cA lack of professional/technical understanding of mental health is something that bothers me sometimes,\u201d Harshit elaborates, \u201cCinema Therapy is a subject of study in itself, and is used by many therapists as a part of psychotherapy.\u201d While his profession doesn\u2019t lie in the film realm (he co-owns artist merchandiser Frankly Wearing), he considers Humans Of Cinema to be more than just a passion project. He recalls a post about Manjari Phadnis\u2019 Meghna from 2008\u2019s Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Naa. \u201cI really didn\u2019t make much of Meghna and always felt like her character hadn\u2019t been done justice in an otherwise well-written film. But in this specific story, the cinephile used instances from her own life to point out that letting Jai go was in itself an act of healing for her and was the most appropriate resolution to the character.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tribute to Robin Williams \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what of global cinema? Harshit says he\u2019d love to up the diversity of the film discourses across Humans Of Cinema, adding, \u201cI also plan to share stories from non-Hindi Indian films as well as foreign language films in the immediate future. As OTT platforms are slowly becoming important parts of our lives and people are keen on exploring meaningful and impactful cinema from around the world, I think it's important for me as someone with this kind of reach to encourage that pattern.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of curating a page such as this is the conversations Harshit has been able to have with other cinephiles. \u201cA Tamasha fan got in touch with me recently to share how the film helped him musterthe courage to leave his job and pursue his passion of writing,\u201d he recalls, \u201cI couldn\u2019t not engage in a conversation with him after that, especially considering how the film was a driving force for me to start the page as well. I\u2019ll probably never meet him, but knowing that both of us share such a special relationship with the same film was kind of a comforting thought in itself \u2014 sometimes, that\u2019s all that you need.\u201d You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "We don\u2019t know much about Vex King. Yet we know everything about him. We\u2019re not privy to his real name, but we know he\u2019s had a rough childhood: he lost his father early to tuberculosis, and his biggest inspiration is his mother. We know that despite missing each other a bunch of times, Vex and his now wife got together nearly a decade ago. The social-media \u2018mind coach\u2019, with his big follower base (of 367k on Instagram; 40k on Facebook; 55.5k on Twitter), popularised the hashtag #GoodVibesOnly. He says he lives on the \u201coutskirts of London\u201d, still holding on to whatever he can about himself. It\u2019s not like his posts demand an overshare; a lot of them are in fact generic messages about self-love, self-acceptance, but in context of his longer captions, they feed into the online world\u2019s thirst for \u2018authentic\u2019, \u2018raw\u2019 content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVex\u2019s popularity is testament to the fact that self-care is the new self-help. While a lot of us might have grown up with Stephen Covey\u2019s 7 Habits series, and somewhat older readers remember the classic Self Help by Samuel Smiles, the push there was on how you could be useful, productive, efficient. And now there\u2019s Good Vibes, Good Life: How Self-Love is the Key to Unlocking Your Greatness, by Vex King. The book, a handy, palm-sized Bible of sorts for the millennial and post-millennial to navigate life, is a stark departure from the traditional self-help. It tells us to slow down, take stock of internal and external developments, and be kinder to ourselves. If you\u2019ve dwelt on your life even a little bit, you\u2019ll find yourself nodding as you read along. At the same time though, you\u2019re also left wondering at the obviousness of it all. \u201cStaying true to yourself\u201d, \u201cChoose real friendships\u201d, \u201cCheck your own behaviour\u201d, and \u201cOne thought is all it takes,\u201d are some of the book\u2019s chapters. In an email interview, Vex talked about why he felt the need to do a book despite massive online following, about #GoodVibesOnly that was his original claim to fame, and the ways in which we are asked to cope with life. Edited excerpts.It must have been around 2012. I was learning a lot about vibration and energy, and realised that higher states of vibrations can help you manifest a good life. Therefore, I thought this phrase would be good to promote. I decided to start a Twitter page after the movement and it grew to over 200,000 followers very quickly. I then decided to push it on other platforms and slowly, I began seeing more people use it.There\u2019s only so much you can say on social media. I want this book to serve as a life guide \u2014 so people could pick it up any time they needed a bit of wisdom, positive reminders or an energetic boost. Nothing compares to physically having a book available at hand where all the information you need is in one place, and easy to navigate through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA literary agent saw how much impact my Instagram posts were making, and so she approached me to ask me if I was interested in writing a book. At this point, I already had a manuscript ready to self-publish. The planning of the book took me two months. The writing took me two weeks. The editing took months. The whole process took one and half years, from start to finish.The reason I actually wrote the section is because I get at least 100 messages a week discussing how much their family is hurting them and not knowing what to do. Many are young girls claiming severe abuse. This topic is always tricky to write about, but is much needed. We are told that family is everything and we should put blood first, but often they can be the biggest reason for mental health problems. The general feedback I\u2019ve got is gratitude \u2014 a lot of people said it was a much-needed topic to discuss.In the office, we have to be self-aware so we can recognise the difference between something that is unhealthy for us and something that requires action. If your manager asks you to work harder, they may be asking because you haven\u2019t put enough effort to reach your potential. To frame this as a toxic demand comes from a perspective of entitlement, instead of understanding you need to and can do more. However, if your manager asks you to work harder in an unjust and malicious manner, you may rightly identify this as a behaviour you do not need to settle for. While this is not always the most practical advice, I do feel your gut (that calm sense of knowing which is not triggered by your conditioning) always knows best. The truth is, we\u2019ll never really know. But, it\u2019s the most empowering way to live life, otherwise we will constantly feel sad when life doesn\u2019t manifest exactly as we imagined,  as we wanted it to. That\u2019s why detachment is so important. To retain happiness, you must let go and have faith that what\u2019s meant to be a part of your life, will eventually be a part of it, even if it isn\u2019t how you initially imagined it.Good Vibes, Good Life: How Self-Love is the Key to Unlocking Your Greatness, \u20b9399, Hay House IndiaYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nThe photo gallery app is designed to work offline and automatically organise photos using Machine Learning\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n To help users store photos in handsets having less storage and unreliable Internet connection, Google has introduced a lighter alternative to Google Photos called \u201cGallery Go\u201d that weighs just 10MB.The photo gallery app is designed to work offline and automatically organise photos using Machine Learning (ML) and help first time smartphone owners easily find, edit, and manage photos, without the need for Internet or Cloud backup.\u201cGallery Go was designed to help you manage your photos using less data. And at just 10 MB, the app won\u2019t slow down your phone and leaves space to store more memories,\u201d Ben Greenwood, Product Manager, Google Photos wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. The light app comes with editing tools for instant fixes along with a variety of filters. Gallery Go is available in the PlayStore for devices running Android 8.1 (Oreo) or higher. \u201cWhile the app is available worldwide, some features such as \u2018organising photos\u2019 by people aren\u2019t available in all countries,\u201d Greenwood added. Details about the wider roll-out of the features currently unavailable for everybody remain undisclosed as of now.Previously, companies like Facebook and Twitter have also rolled-out \u201cLite\u201d versions of their main apps. Google has also done something similar on the operating system (OS) level with Android Go \u2014 a lightweight Android-based OS designed to run on cheaper smartphones.

        "\nFacebook brought in almost $56 billion in revenue in 2018.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to announce on Wednesday that Facebook has agreed to a sweeping settlement of significant allegations it mishandled user privacy and pay $5 billion, two people briefed on the matter said.As part of the settlement, Facebook will agree to create a board committee on privacy and will agree to new executive certifications that users' privacy is being properly protected, the people said.Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will have to certify every three months that the company is properly safeguarding user privacy, a person briefed on the matter said.Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to announce a related settlement with Facebook for around $100 million over allegations it failed to disclose risks to investors over its privacy practices. The Wall Street Journal reported the SEC settlement earlier.The Post also reported the FTC also plans to allege Facebook provided insufficient information to about 30 million users about a facial recognition tool, an issue identified earlier by Consumer Reports.The settlement comes amid growing concern among U.S. policymakers about the privacy of online users and have sparked calls for new legal protections in Congress. Separately, the U.S. Justice Department said late Tuesday it is launching a broad antitrust probe into the competitive practices of large tech companies like Facebook.Two people briefed on the matter confirmed the Post report the FTC will not require Facebook to admit guilt as part of the settlement. The settlement will need to be approved by a federal judge and will contain other significant allegations of privacy lapses, the people said.The fine will mark the largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC.The FTC confirmed in March 2018 it had opened an investigation into allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the data sharing violated a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the regulator and then widened to include other privacy allegations.A person briefed on the matter said the phone number, facial recognition and two-factor authentication issues were not part of the initial Cambridge Analytica probe.Some in Congress have criticized the reported $5 billion penalty, noting Facebook in 2018 had $55.8 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in net income. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, said last week the fine should be $50 billion.While the deal resolves a major regulatory headache for Facebook, the Silicon Valley firm still faces further potential antitrust probes as the FTC and Justice Department undertake a wide-ranging review of competition among the biggest U.S. tech companies. Facebook is also facing public criticism from President Donald Trump and others about its planned cryptocurrency Libra over concerns about privacy and money laundering.The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.But the company's core business has proven resilient, as Facebook blew past earnings estimates in the past two quarters.

        "couldnt find the paragraph",
        "\nRepresentational image of a lipstick wearer\n\u00a0 A smear, a swipe; the simplicity of the lipstick hasn\u2019t gone under-appreciated in the centuries observed by this little beauty gadget. According to Orbis Research, the global cosmetics market is expected to reach a market value of US$805.61 billion by 2023, a figure with way too many commas if converted to Indian rupees.In a tube with a bullet or in liquid form with a doe-foot applicator, the lipstick doesn\u2019t merely take up a little space on the vanity but also shows how technology has nurtured a relationship with the beauty industry over the past century.Think about the ergonomics of a lipstick; how the lipstick bullet is designed is reliant on technology and intense study \u2014 a factor which affects the final purchase. The tapered end of a lipstick bullet allows the wearer to apply with precision at the outer edges of the lip, and the diameter has been constructed for careful thought into the pressure during application. Browsing online for lipstick is almost as intense as browsing for a car; the look, feel and durability have to be just right\u2026 and if they aren\u2019t, well, there are thousands of alternatives to consider.Some brands offer various try-on techniques for shoppers; while Sephora India takes the try-on method further, promising \u2018natural light\u2019 in-store, the Lakm\u00e9 Makeup Pro app, lets you simply upload a picture of yourself and you can \u2018apply\u2019 the different shades of lipsticks for sale and see how they fare with your complexion. This method, which employs a dose of Artificial Intelligence to \u2018read\u2019 the customer\u2019s face, isn\u2019t exactly favoured by many shoppers for two reasons: some aren\u2019t comfortable with their picture being uploaded to any server, plus the lighting in which you take said picture may not match up with your true complexion, which can affect your purchase. And, of course, the feel of the lipstick isn\u2019t conveyed as well as when a customer physically tries it on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample of Smashbox\u2019s 3-D printed lipstick\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Smashbox Cosmetics invited beauty enthusiasts to enjoy 3-D printed lipsticks through their #Belegendary 120 Lipstick Matching Game. The customer was allowed to choose any design of which the print would get super-imposed into a mirror compact, and you can apply the lipstick using a brush or your fingers. Not your typical lipstick bullet but the company appealed to the customisation most wanted at the time. Before companies moved to putting lipsticks into a tube and adding (and then removing) chemicals, ancient natural constructions of lipsticks were deemed the original means of manufacturing. Last year, Weibo user MianYiang Danshen went viral for her visually calming videos of creating make-up from raw materials from her backyard. For lipsticks and lipstains, she used careful proportions of rose petal dyes, white wine, honey and oil... and a lot of patience. Safe to say, without these techniques, we wouldn\u2019t have been where we are today with the cosmetics industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u2018Kiss Of Death\u2019 at New York City\u2019s KGB Museum \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to the Cold War. Lipsticks weren\u2019t only a beautification accessory small enough to fit in your clutch. Peruse history books and indulge in enough James Bond films, and it won\u2019t surprise you that lipsticks have been used as weapons. At KGB Espionage Museum in New York City, the Kiss of Death appears to be a simple lipstick in a chrome silver case, the bullet (no pun intended) itself a true red. But it\u2019s actually a single-shot, small-caliber gun. The one pictured was designed for use by KGB operatives during the Cold War, and this particular gun was confiscated at an American checkpoint in West Berlin.Then there are times lipstick-like projects don\u2019t turn out. Remember the Nokia 7280? The phone was also dubbed the \u2018lipstick phone\u2019, given its cosmetic-like appearance.An out-of-the-box creation, it was mocked relentlessly for the non-functional experience it offered. Back when gender politics seemed to be worth ignoring, the 7280 was designed \u2018with women in mind\u2019 and had a Navi spinner as a central control unit, which made the already-tiny device difficult to use with input and output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nokia 7280 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile many continue to poke fun at the Nokia 7280 for its misogynistic undertones, it\u2019s worth mentioning how unconventional mobile phone design was the \u2018must be\u2019 of early-2000s technology.The beauty vlogging industry is practically a whole economy on its own. According to a dataset by Mediakix\u2019s 2019 \u2018Influencer Marketing Survey\u2019, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022. But what happens when those numbers turn on the creators of lipsticks themselves?In May, YouTuber and entrepreneur Jaclyn Hill released her own cosmetics line and unveiled a line of lipsticks. Many fans, including those in India, placed orders. However, according to customers around the globe, many lipsticks turned out to have mold, unidentified black spots, white hairs, or uneven texture \u2014 all showcased in social media posts on Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. But it didn\u2019t stop there; the publicity-heavy space of YouTube sent Jaclyn into the frontline of a battle with trolls, angry fans and other entrepreneurs, who either pointed out or refuted the claims of a poorly-maintained lab and compromised ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeauty vlogger and entrepreneur Jaclyn Hill and one of the lipsticks received by a customer \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the first wave of dissent, a statement was released by Jaclyn Cosmetics stating, \u201cJaclyn Cosmetics are made with cosmetic industry-standard, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-compliant ingredients and are produced in an OTC (Over the Counter) compliant factory that is registered with the FDA, providing high degrees of safety standards and rigorous testing\u2026 The preservative system, material composition of the formula, and processing temperature of our lipstick does not support microbial growth and protects the product through the expiration date of May 2021.\u201dSoftware developer Ritu Shetty (26) in Gurugram, who ordered a few of the lipsticks, believes popularity in the online space can cloud one\u2019s judgement. \u201cThese lipsticks aren\u2019t \u2018budget\u2019 by any means, so you\u2019re really paying for the connection with a creator. I think online platforms such as YouTube and social media, where you can see and interact with the creator, can swell the problems and anger. If you have issues with brands that don\u2019t have that one active face you can associate with the brand, you are bound to have less of a backlash.\u201dThe infrastructures of YouTube and Instagram have helped usher in an Age of Enlightenment around beauty conscientiousness. Many can argue that were it not for these platforms, young people, whether they live in Tier 1 or Tier 3 cities, wouldn\u2019t be so keenly interested about what goes into the mass market cosmetics.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "The story so far: For a little over a decade, the term blockchain has been flitting in and out of news cycles, especially in connection with bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency. The Reserve Bank of India has banned speculation and investment in cryptocurrencies. Of late, however, blockchain is seeing a revival, and companies are looking at how to use the tremendous potential of the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency.It is a foundational technology or a platform that allows designing a secure way to record transactions and circulate it among signatories, or any kind of target group with an Internet connection. At its core it is an extremely democratic ledger that cannot be arbitarily manipulated and easily shareable.Blockchain\u2019s appeal is that it achieves this without a central authority. Blockchain burst into public consciousness because of its association with Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious individual or cabal that laid out a white paper on how blockchain could be applied to bitcoin, a virtual currency wrought from the principles of blockchain. Having money free of the fiat of Central governments raised utopian possibilities especially in a world where democracies complain of being subverted and labour and capital continue to be entangled in the elusive quest for equilibrium. Thereafter, it spawned its own hype-cycle, imitation currencies, association with the sordid and Dark Net. While cryptocurrencies have a bad reputation, Silicon Valley tech giants and investment banks are trying to salvage the underlying promise of blockchain and use it for other collaborations. \n\nAlso read \n\nBitcoin: the birth of an asset\nKeerthik Sasidharan\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0Also read  Bitcoin: the birth of an assetEvery block in a blockchain is a record of transactions and the more of the latter, the longer the chain. Just as worthless paper transforms into valuable currency with the signature of the RBI governor, blocks are great because they provide an unalterable document of the history of every transaction. In the context of currency, it stores the place, time, value (rupee, for example) and location of a purchase. There is minimal identifying information and every block is linked to a unique \u2018digital signature\u2019 of the transacting participants. Every block is distinguished from another through a unique code which is a string of numbers. When you use your debit or credit card to make a transaction, VISA or Mastercard employ their technology to verify your bank account, connect with banks and process a transaction. In blockchain applications, this verifying role is outsourced to several computers on a network \u2014 each has the exact same copy of the block. These computers verify the genuineness of transaction by solving mathematical problems that can only be done in brute-force, energy intensive ways that require a lot of computational power, and therefore electricity. This is a key reason why blockchain enthusiasts vouch for the security of blockchain-backed transactions. Depending on where the blockchain technology is deployed, these participating computers or users have to be incentivised for all that energy expenditure.In the case of bitcoin, the computers are rewarded with bitcoin. This is stored in digital wallets and may be used like money provided there are sellers of real world goods who would accept bitcoins. Nowdays, they are frequently traded as another speculative, volatile asset.As of today nothing, but blockchain backers say it solves the problem of \u2018trust\u2019. Because the major cost of any transaction or exchange of services or goods is the act of verification \u2014 VISA charges fees to ensure that your card swipe is connected to your account or a property charges you for the effort of ensuring that you are entering into a genuine transaction \u2014 blockchain asks you to trust the energy-intensive nature of mathematical problems and have them masquerade them as \u2018locks\u2019 to secure your money, confidential documents or any kind of information. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of blockchain \n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of blockchain While blockchain has the aura of transparency \u2014 anybody supposedly can check the history of a \u2018block\u2019 \u2014 it is at its core impervious to common sense. However, just as the inability to grasp in a visceral sense how letters typed on a mobile phone transform and make their way into another phone instantaneously a continent away does not stop people from using WhatsApp, blockchain technology has created enough hype and drama to have drawn the world\u2019s wealthiest to invest in it and inveigle it into ordinary lives.Facebook this year announced Libra, a kind of blockchain-backed digital currency. According to report in a 2017 issue of the Harvard Business Review (HBR), \u201cBank of America, JPMorgan, the New York Stock Exchange, Fidelity Investments, and Standard Chartered are testing blockchain technology as a replacement for paper-based and manual transaction processing in such areas as trade finance, foreign exchange, cross-border settlement, and securities settlement\u201dEthereum is another blockchain-based startup that looks to decentralise online information. Its ambition is beyond overturning online banking and it claims that if it were to work as envisioned, it will give users control over their data unlike the present where a lot of our privacy is ceded to Google and Amazon\u2019s servers. Some plan to apply blockchain to trace the origin of food and where it is grown and yet others to journalism and \u2018fact-checking\u2019 applications. Unlike blockchain\u2019s distributed computing philosophy, all these applications ultimately store information on a coalition of repositories.The HBR article cited earlier, by Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani, likens blockchain to the early days of the Internet, which was made possible by so-called distributed computing. A new mode, called the TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol), which specified how computers could be networked to transmit and receive packets of digital information, turned out to be a platform that laid the base for private networks, email, the web, websites, search engines. TCP/IP minimises central management and makes networks resilient and far-reaching. The protocol was not the crying need of humanity but once in place, upended the telecommunications industry and in the last three decades virtually every aspect of life.Technology has always proved to be disruptive, creating new opportunities and jobs and destroying old ones. If blockchain\u2019s appeal lies in its appeal to destroy intermediaries \u2014 banks, courts, lawyers \u2014 it is unlikely to be smooth sailing. Moreover, there is already serious theorising by economists that shows how blockchain has its own vulnerabilities and susceptibility to creating new hegemons, power networks, cartels and challenges to global energy consumption.",
        "\nAn aerial view of the LIGO detector site near Livingston, Louisiana, U.S. that was released by Caltech/MIT/LIGO Laboratory in 2016. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nLIGO Laboratory\n The story so far: On September 14, 2015, the two LIGO detectors in the U.S., at Livingston in Louisiana, and Hanford in Washington, registered a disturbance that was not unlike the chirp of a bird. It was due to gravitational waves travelling outwards from a point 1.3 billion light years away from the earth. At this point, two massive black holes with masses 29 and 36 times that of the sun had merged to give off gravitational wave disturbances. Black holes are exotic objects that we know little about, but their immense gravitational pull which traps even the fastest object in the world, which is light, is legendary. When objects with such an immense gravity merge, the disturbance is felt by the very fabric of space time and travels outward from the merger, not unlike ripples on a pond surface. Thus, gravitational waves have been described as \u201cripples in the fabric of space time\u201d. Following the 2015 detection, which later won the Physics Nobel (2017), the two LIGO detectors detected seven such binary black hole merger events before they were joined by the European Virgo detector in 2017. The two facilities have now detected 10 events. The Japanese detector, KAGRA, or Kamioka Gravitational-wave Detector, is expected to join the international network soon. In the meantime, in a collaboration with LIGO, a gravitational wave detector is being set up in India. The LIGO India project is expected to join the international network in a first science run in 2025.The acronym LIGO stands for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. LIGO consists of a pair of huge interferometers, each having two arms which are 4 km long. Remarkable precision is needed to detect a signal as faint as a gravitational wave, and the two LIGO detectors work as one unit to ensure this. Naturally, this requires weeding out noise very carefully, for when such a faint signal is being detected, even a slight human presence near the detector could derail the experiment by drowning out the signal.LIGO, unlike usual telescopes, does not \u201csee\u201d the incoming ripples in spacetime. It does not even need to, because gravitational waves are not a part of electromagnetic spectrum or light. They are not light waves but a different phenomenon altogether \u2014 a stretching of spacetime due to immense gravity. A single LIGO detector cannot confidently detect this disturbance on its own. At least two detectors are needed. This is because the signal is so weak that even a random noise could give out a signal that can mislead one into thinking a genuine gravitational wave has been detected. It is because two detectors have detected the faint signal in coincidence that the observer is convinced it is a genuine reading and not noise.Right now, with just three detectors, there is huge uncertainty in determining where in the sky the disturbance came from. Observations from a new detector in a far-off position will help locate the source of the gravitational waves more accurately. Mergers of black holes or neutron stars, rapidly rotating neutron stars, supernova explosions and the remnants of the disturbance caused by the formation of the universe, the Big Bang itself, are the strongest sources. There can be many other sources, but these are likely to be too weak to detect.As a largely unknown and fundamental phenomenon, gravitational waves are interesting to scientists. But once many more detectors are in place, the study also offers a new way to map out the universe, using gravitational-wave astronomy. Perhaps one day we will have such accurate detection facilities that signatures of gravitational waves bouncing off celestial objects can help us detect and map them.LIGO India will come up in Maharashtra, near Aundha in Hingoli district. Most of the land has been acquired, and the small balance is going through a slightly longer acquisition procedure. The project is formally in the construction phase, with the building design conceptualised. Says Tarun Souradeep, spokesperson for LIGO India, \u201cWe are close to finalising the civil infrastructure drawings. The plans for immense vacuum infrastructure have been conceptualized, reviewed and are in an advanced stage.\u201d Like the LIGO detectors, the one at LIGO India will also have two arms of 4 km length. But while there are similarities there will be differences too. Being an ultra-high precision large-scale apparatus, LIGO India is expected to show a unique \u201ctemperament\u201d determined by the local site characteristics. In an email to The Hindu, Dr. Souradeep, says, \u201cLIGO India and its complex feedback control loops to high sensitivity will follow a fairly independent track and poses an exciting full-scale challenge. Under a memorandum of understanding, the National Geophysical Research Institute is carrying out a year-long, multiple-station seismic survey campaign at the LIGO India site to characterise the local properties. This is in addition to the elaborate geotechnical and geophysical survey completed earlier this year.\u201d Some of it includes design and fabrication of ultra stable laser, quantum measurement techniques, handling of complex control system for enforcing precision control, large-scale ultra-high vacuum technology, data analysis and machine learning. This is not a complete list and the development of such indigenous technology is likely to result in many spin-offs for industry and research.",

Just like traditional sports, playing video games with my children helps me bond,\u201d said Wayne Williams, who was there with his family. He enjoys playing FIFA and Call of Duty with his two children, he said. Anusha Sanniboyina from Avanti College grew up playing games like Need For Speed and GTA Vice City with her brother. These days it is PUBG she is hooked to. GamerConnect organised tournaments for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO); Mortal Kombat 11; FIFA 19 and PUBG Lite which saw big numbers participating. Owing to their popularity, more than half of the gaming PCs were allocated to them. Mortal Kombat 11 tournament was played on a gaming console. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuneeth Suganli, a student of Andhra University and an enthusiastic gamer was delighted with the first-of-its-kind gaming event in the city. He said, \u201cGamerConnect did not just focus on conducting tournaments. It also jazzed up the day with quizzes, invited professional gamers to interact with fans and brought in the latest gaming technology for sale.\u201dFast and the curiousOrionx2 Dual System Extreme by Overclocked, UK-based company is the world\u2019s most expensive PC. It costs around \u00a333,000.Those who follow CS: GO eSport events, were in for a treat. They met Ankit Panth, captain of Team Brutality, a professional eSports team. One of the leading players in India, he has been in the profession for the past 10 years. \u201cPUBG Mobile has injected gaming culture in India; people from the age of eight to 48 years are playing the game on their smartphones,\u201d stated Ankit, who spent most of his time talking with fans and taking selfies with them. As of June 2019, PUBG Mobile has 400 million downloads in Android and iOS platforms and last year it recorded over 30 million daily active users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSohan Beela, an aspiring professional gamer, said some of the first games he played were Delta Force and Road Rash. After stumbling upon video-game streamers from India on YouTube, he knew he wanted to get professional. \u201cI watch online streamers not just for entertainment but to learn new strategies ,\u201d he said. Streaming from the bayDeepak Pemmisetty is a Visakhapatnam-based video game streamer set up a YouTube account and started streaming Let\u2019s Play videos in Telugu of games like GTA V and PUBG. He maintains multiplayer games like PUBG get better responses than single player games. But when the 19-year-old got some harsh comments on YouTube, he stopped streaming for a while. \u201cInternet can be cruel, we all know that.I felt really bad. Now, I have learned to ignore the trolls and just do what I love,\u201d he says.Deepak prefers to play on a PC because there is more variety.Ankit sounded some words of warning about misconceptions young people had about getting famous overnight in the gaming industry. \u201cSkipping education is a bad idea and I encourage my fans to focus on overall development so that they can build a brand around themselves.\u201dAlong with gaming, Ankit also does deejaying and is working to build his fitness brand. Similarly, Ishaan reckons being a professional player is not the only way to be a part of the industry. \u201cThe rise of eSports and gaming as entertainment is creating a need for editors, content creators, presenters, commentators and writers ,\u201d he added.A group of Koreans whowere from PUBG Corporation, quietly observed the proceedings. Sein Sohn, Chief Financial Officer of PUBG Corporation, said, \u201cPUBG Mobile\u2019s success in India, has laid the foundation for its PC version.\u201d When asked if they would have an office in India, the response was a smiling, \u201cHopefully, in the future.\u201d You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0 There\u2019s a part in Judgment during which our hero Takayuki Yagami \u2014 while staggering, beaten and bruised \u2014 looks at a bunch of Yakuza, muttering the words \u201cYou guys have had your turn,\u201d before yelling, \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now!\u201dA direct reference to the Yakuza series, the flagship games of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the masters of mellodramatic beat-em-ups that are so pulpy and good, it\u2019s hard to put down. After a decent goodbye to their righteous hero Kazuma Kiryu in a lacklustre Yakuza 6, Judgment marks a new beginning with a fresh new face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakayuki Yagami was one of the best lawyers out there, who quit soon after he found out that he was responsible for setting a serial killer free. Starting his own detective agency, he\u2019s sworn to make amends and find the person responsible... to find this killer with a penchant for poking out nice folks\u2019 eyes, and bring this person to justice.JudgmentDeveloper: Ryu Ga Gotoku StudioPublisher: SegaPrice: \u20b92,999 for PlayStation 4Set in the familiar district that\u2019s become the staple of the Yakuza series, Kamurocho, Judgment features an all-new cast of characters that are more down-to-earth, telling a tale that is darker, and unlike anything the series is known for. Takayuki himself is a really good character with a roguish charm about him, who along with his partner Kaito, an ex-Yakuza, makes quite the team as they descend into the seedy underbelly of a seedy part of Japan. Those who shied away from the subtitled Japanese of the previous games will be happy to know that it\u2019s got English voices too, but there\u2019s a certain charm of hearing the original performances in Japanese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few hours into the game and we have just one question on our minds, how does Yagami, a desk jockey lawyer, have intense martial arts training, especially proficient in three fighting styles. Some of it is answered in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with his boss, where it\u2019s mentioned that he was a street thug before becoming a lawyer. Yet, it\u2019s something of which we just can\u2019t quite get a hang of. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the action is fantastic, going back to the fun of Yakuza 0 and we would accept it if his fighting style was anything thug-like... yet Yagami breaks out some crazy acrobatic fighting techniques that no law school would ever teach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, most of the game has you doing detective stuff, which involves skulking around, tailing people, finding clues, doing a lot of investigating, all done in various mini-games that are a fun take on the hard-boiled detective genre. Then there are the lawyer parts which have you use your evidence against various parties to call them out on their crimes with proof, playing out like Ace Attorney, which I covered fairly recently. Then there are the engaging cut-scenes that play out like fine wine. After that, you have Yagami go stomp on a bunch of thugs\u2019 heads with kung fu, while you rub your head at the transition.Kamurocho proves to be the real hero of the game with a multitude of things to do in its neon and rain-soaked streets. You can walk around the city and play a bunch of mini games as well as meet a whole bunch of colourful folks from either side of the law. As you take on the Yakuza, crooked cops and everything in between.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the two halves of the game share an uneasy coexistence, Judgment is a long and meaty crime game that is full of repetitive chase sequences and fights, but it more than makes up for it with its clever cases and engrossing storyline.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "\n(L-R) Aryan Chand, Aryan Srivastava, Neil Dey, and Akaash Parthasarathy\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n When they joined the LaunchX club in their school in July last year, Neil Dey (17), Akaash Parthsarathy (14), Aryan Srivastava (14), and Aryan Chand (15) thought their interest in tech would carry them through. Dey was in Class XI, and the rest were in Class IX. Once in the programme, this band of students from Shri Ram School, Aravali, Gurugram, realised there were different nuances within tech that appealed to each of them. LaunchX, an independent high-school-level offshoot of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Launch, is a fully planned course-load, alongside regular school work. Its mission is \u201cto empower young people to build the future\u201d, and to give them \u201cthe entrepreneurial skills and mindset to start real companies\u201d. Through the pre-programme test and course work phases, Dey found that he engaged with tech best through a business development perspective; Parthasarathy realised he was good with numbers and with money; Srivastava, that he has a knack to understand the tech market; and Chand, his passion for the nitty gritty of the tech itself.It is this alchemy of talents, brought together as their startup-in-the-making Swifi, that saw them through the Asia finals of LaunchX in Bangkok this March. Here, Swifi, which makes affordable home automation systems with manual control options in case of Wi-Fi failure, was given the Top Inventor and Global Finalist titles, pushing them to qualify for the main summer LaunchX programme at MIT later in May.Thinking of privacySwifi believes that \u201ceventually, we\u2019re moving into a world where every little bit about us is going to be available to everyone.\u201d Having said that, they have thought of the data that their devices collect. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything to protect privacy \u2014 the data is not even going to be accessible to us, only to the device,\u201d Dey says.Both these events were like Shark Tank, the popular American reality TV show that gives aspiring entrepreneurs a chance to pitch their products to a panel of insanely wealthy investors. Except here, the young entrepreneurs get sustained mentorship and connections instead of investors.\u201cThe idea is to help us prep for and build an actual company, which solves an existing problem in the market at the end of the day. It\u2019s not just about a \u2018school project\u2019,\u201d explains Chand.Home automation, the tech that lets you switch your electrical appliances on and off remotely, isn\u2019t really a new concept at all. But its adoption rate in India is low and slow. The sheer expense of making a home \u2018smart\u2019 is the primary reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototypes of Swifi\u2019s devices\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis adds to the mindset that people have right now, where they just don\u2019t see the point of home automation. Not only is it convenient, but it also helps you gain insights into your power usage patterns, especially if the device comes with an app, like ours does,\u201d says Dey. \u201cPeople are more willing to experience it if it\u2019s a small investment, so cost-efficiency is a massive selling point.\u201dTo tackle this price barrier, Swifi sources all parts of their standard switch-board-sized device from the local electronics market. This reduces their overheads. Additionally, instead of investing in an injection mould right away to make the device, they\u2019re currently only 3D-printing. \u201cWe\u2019ll only invest in a one-time injection moulding once this is finalised,\u201d Dey says.Giants like Philips Hue offer only individual smart lights between \u20b92,500 and \u20b93,000. Another competitor, Sonoff, has a device much like Swifi\u2019s, which can control four to eight smart appliances for a price of \u20b98,000; however, Swifi\u2019s device distinguishes itself in this segment not only with a lower price (\u20b92,500 to \u20b93,000), but also by offering control to bigger appliances like air-conditioners and geysers. The team has also added a remote-control for the devices, in addition to their compatibility with smart assistants like Google Home and Alexa, as well as an in-house app.Still self-funded and helped along through the resources of family and friends, the four students behind Swifi are now planning to participate in national competitions such as Techronext, an ICT conclave by the Punjab Public School in Nabha, Patiala. They will also soon start a crowd-funding campaign to be able to take it to market. The immediate aim is to start selling their devices by the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year.

        "\nGoing beyong the ABCs of regional languages \u00a0 Keeping up with technology can be disorienting \u2014 no wonder cyber-caf\u00e9s seem like they are from Prehistoric eras. But not all industries have seen a transformation like the telecommunications industry... and regional Indian language is one such industry. Even if we combine the types of fonts for 11 most spoken Indian languages, it still falls drastically short of the plethora of English fonts. As a result, the playing field for regional content producers is far from level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverie Language Technologies improves local language fonts \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDesigning Indian language fonts isn\u2019t a problem, but its interaction with existing technology is. The technology or format used for Indian language fonts is OpenType (made by Microsoft and Adobe), which deviated from the previous format and grammar guidelines significantly. Since these rules can\u2019t be customised, it takes time to build Indic fonts,\u201d says Vivekanand Pani, co-founder of Reverie Language Technologies (RLT). According to Vivekanand, it\u2019s crucial for India to build technologies to make it easier for developers to use local language fonts. When RLT first entered the space of localising content in 2009, the demand for local language fonts was booming, with rapid growth in the smartphone industry. RLT eventually recognised the high demand for regional language fonts. In 2010, it offered fonts and display solutions for the electronic programme guides were displayed on set-top boxes. In the next four years, they integrated all Indian languages on the Qualcomm platform and established links with the original equipment manufacturer for Indian-language fonts. In 2014, RLT offered language solutions to Micromax. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverie Language Technologies helped phone manufactures add local languages \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to achieve accurate translations, RLT doesn\u2019t reply based on only computer-assisted translation but also professional linguistics. \u201cEvery language has its own nuances. We understand the importance of recognising context while translating,\u201d says Vivekanand. In fact, Indian Software Product Industry RoundTable approached them after demonetisation in 2016 to localise text strings in BHIM, a mobile payment App developed by the National Payments Corporation of India, based on the Unified Payments Interface.\u201cOver 20% of our users prefer to use the app in their native language. Reverie\u2019s services have helped us gain access to customers,\u201d says Himanshu Periwal, vice president of growth at travel and hotel booking e-commerce website Ixigo. Over the last seven years, RLT has managed to work with large clients like Vijaya Bank, UrbanClap, Ola, Government of Karnataka, Government of Rajasthan, Ixigo and others. Currently, RLT supports Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Assamese, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. In August, RLT will launch the updated version of Prabandhak, an AI-powered translation marketplace with an Indic spell-check feature. Prabandhak can be used by companies or individuals.In the long run, RLT intends to work with government regulatory bodies to establish Indian language standards that are not only suited for Indian languages but also defined and owned by India.A little over a year old, Vokal, a knowledge-sharing app, has over a million downloads already \u2014 most of the user base coming from the North Indian belt of tier 2 cities.

Most of these new smartphone users don\u2019t speak in English,\u201d says Mayank. \u201cFor entertainment, they have TikTok and YouTube, for news they have local apps, but we are aggregating everything, even generic life lessons, friendly advice, on to one platform.\u201dThink of it as an Indianised version of Quora \u2014 as if it could get any more Indian than it is now! Or even an Indian Reddit. However, here\u2019s the key difference: the entire app is clearly audio-video forward.\u201cWe have regular Quora users also on our app, and here they are 10 times more active. Why? Because of the ease of it. You ask anyone, would they rather read an answer, or listen to it, people will go for the latter. Even those who contribute answers prefer answering over video than text; it\u2019s the natural way,\u201d Mayank says.It\u2019s not officialDespite the many languages spoken in the United States of America, the country does not have an official language.The idea behind Vokal, he emphasises, is enabling content creation and helping people by providing trustworthy answers to questions they would not have easily had in their mother tongues. With features such as Ask Directly, a person can get immediate access to an expert in the field.But here rises a risk: who do we consider an \u2018expert\u2019? While Mayank claims that they approach people who are well-established names in the field, say in the field of health, a Head of Department would be considered an expert. However, a test run of the Hindi section throws up multiple answers in which the \u2018experts\u2019 masquerade opinions as facts.To be fair, it does open avenues for discussion, but the power balance is heavily in favour of those deemed experts. Given that the app just started in other languages, it remains to be seen if the trend shifts depending on regional politics.One thing is for sure: there is no better feel for the myriad dreams, aspirations, and concerns of the Indian multitude than an app that promotes discussion in local languages. For this, English just won\u2019t do.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

        "\nJony Ive\n\u00a0 The man behind the iconic designs of the iPhone, iMac and iPad is leaving Apple. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive is departing after more than two decades at Apple to start his own design firm, the company said Thursday. But he\u2019s not completely severing ties with the company he has worked at for nearly 30 years. Apple said it will be one of Mr. Ive\u2019s clients at his new firm.The Cupertino, California, company did not give an exact date for his departure. Mr. Ive has been a fixture on Apple\u2019s design team since the early 1990s and is known for shaping Apple\u2019s signature rounded, stylish designs. Mr. Ive joined the company in 1992 as a young senior designer. Apple\u2019s co-founder and longtime leader Steve Jobs was in the midst of his 12-year exile at the time, and upon his return he named Mr. Ive senior vice president of industrial design. The pair were known to work closely together in the decades before Jobs\u2019 death in 2011 once, Mr. Jobs referred to Ive as his \u201cspiritual partner.\u201d Walter Isaacson, who wrote the 2011 biography \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d quotes the Jobs describing Mr. Ive as \u201cwickedly intelligent in all ways.\u201d \u201cHe gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product. And he understands that Apple is a product company. He is not just a designer,\u201d Jobs told Isaacson. \u201cHe has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me.\u201d The name for Mr. Ive\u2019s new design company, LoveFrom, comes from something Jobs once said to him, Mr. Ive told the Financial Times in an interview published Thursday. Mr. Jobs said making something with \u201clove and care\u201d was a fundamental component and doing so meant you were \u201cexpressing your gratitude to humanity, to the species.\u201d \u201cI so identified with that motivation and was moved by his description,\u201d Mr. Ive said. Ive, Isaacson wrote, is a fan of the German industrial designer Dieter Rams, who \u201cpreached the gospel of \u2018less but better.\u2019\u201d Apple\u2019s designs, led by Ive, have become synonymous with elegant simplicity. \u201cSimplicity isn\u2019t just a visual style,\u201d Ive told Isaacson. \u201cIt\u2019s not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep.\u201d Ive was eventually promoted to his head of design role, where he shaped the simplistic and people-friendly phones and computers for which Apple has become known. Ive had a say in it all, from the bright, rounded iMacs of the 1990s to the sleek, silver and black iPhones of today. In more recent years, Ive put part of his focus into designing the company\u2019s giant spaceship-like campus, Apple Park. Mr. Ive, who grew up outside London, was knighted at Buckingham Palace in 2012. He studied design at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University) in Newcastle, England, and founded his own design company called Tangerine work that would lead him to Apple.

        "\nThe Like logo on a sign at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California on April 25, 2019.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Facebook is updating its terms and services guidelines to clarify how it makes money from the personal information of its users. The changes reflect its ongoing attempts to satisfy regulators in the U.S. and Europe, which have urged the company to make sure users know what they are signing up for. The guideline changes, announced on June 27, are largely cosmetic. The updates don\u2019t change Facebook\u2019s underlying policies. Facebook has come under fire with regulators in Europe, and increasingly in the U.S., for how it handles personal information collected on its site and how transparent it is with users. The company said it made the updates after working with a European consumer protection group and regulators around the world. The European Commission noted Facebook\u2019s agreement to make the changes in April, saying the commission requested changes \u201cto clearly inform consumers how the social network gets financed\u201d. This is how Facebook\u2019s new guidelines tackle that challenge: \u201cInstead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products.\u201d The terms and services spell out that even if users delete material from the site, it might still exist on Facebook\u2019s servers for 90 days. It also makes clear that violating the company\u2019s policies could get posts removed from the site and explains that users still own the material they post online, although Facebook may use it. But at nearly 10 pages long in PDF form, Facebook is still facing the most common problem with lengthy terms and services people rarely read them. Facebook will issue a blog post on the changes, which go into effect July 31, but won\u2019t require users to agree again to the updated terms. It also won\u2019t promote the updates on people\u2019s Facebook feeds. The company said it decided not to make people re-sign the agreement because the changes merely clarify existing policy and don\u2019t change it. Facebook, along with other big internet companies, have been increasingly scrutinised in 2018 about how well they protect people\u2019s data and how they profit from it. The company is under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy practices.

        "Watching IPL and the ICC Cricket World Cup now just doesn\u2019t have the thrilling fun it used to back in the day. Now we have to bear the advertisements shoved in our line of vision; it\u2019s simply not enough that the field, uniforms and screens blatantly blare the sponsorships, but each precious over is interrupted by a cheesy commercial, brainwashing us to buy the next smartphone or the next paint for that one wall in our living rooms. Entertainment has changed the game, making the most of the openly-available Internet bandwidths to embrace streaming and video-on-demand (VOD) services. That\u2019s why Tata Sky Binge entered the playing field \u2014 pun totally intended. With a monthly fee of \u20b9249, subscribers now have access to videos. The review device I received was a limited-edition Amazon Fire TV Stick with the Tata Sky graphics spewed across it; as a consumer, you simply rent the Fire TV Stick (which has an MRP of \u20b93999) but pay only the \u20b9249 a month for the Tata Sky Binge. For those trying to save for an Amazon Fire TV Stick, this could be a useful hack... but you have to have a set-top-box. I don\u2019t need to name the other VOD services which run independently from their set-top-boxes because, well, not everyone finds the need to invest in one. Besides, if I already have a Fire TV Stick, wouldn\u2019t the app be free to download if the subscription is paid?Content-wise, it took me only a few minutes of browsing to really know that I wasn\u2019t exactly their target market; as someone who wants the latest content but doesn\u2019t watch television per se, there wasn\u2019t much of a thrill. But Tata Sky Binge does offer a fair share of the programmes we may miss on television while we\u2019re at work, such as cricket highlights or the latest episode of that slap-filled soap opera. According to the company, there are over 5000 titles in the library from which to choose, plus you \u2014 of course \u2014 get the premium content from the apps you still have to pay for, like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The Tata Sky Binge content, however, has a seven-day shelf-life, proving this is actually to play \u2018catch up\u2019 on a rainy day rather than a full-blown entertainer night in with friends. Sure, my mind wasn\u2019t blown by this service, but there is a community to which Tata Sky Binge caters, which is probably why it\u2019s only at \u20b9249 a month. My advice? Test it out first if there\u2019s a store near you. You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

        "Growing up in Calcutta in the 80s, Atul Jalan was introduced to reading with Russian literature (\u201cperhaps due to the commie influence of that time,\u201d he guesses). In class seven, he says, he was familiar with the works of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Chekhov. Soon, he moved on to science fiction \u2014 HG Wells, Isaac Assimov, Arthur C Clarke who fascinated young Atul endlessly. He, then, wished he lived in an era of a major technological revolution so he could witness a great change taking place in the world. Three decades later, Atul, now a tech entrepreneur (he is the founder-CEO of an Artificial Intelligence venture, Manthan), believes he\u2019s living on the cusp of the upheaval of human species. And to capture this paradigm shift, Atul has written the book, Where Will Man Take Us?, which explores the astonishing changes technology is bringing about in us.MetroPlus asks him to elaborate on the possibilities of five dramatic future scenarios.I don\u2019t think that is going to happen. We are a smart species. Instead of robots ruling over us, I think, we will be cyborgs. And, that is not a frightening situation to me. We are, to an extent, cyborgs already, because of the smartphones we use. Let us take Stephen Hawking\u2019s case. With ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), how was he able to communicate? The computer would generate speech through the twitching of muscles in his cheek. He was using the first generation brain-computer interface. In another three to four years, we will have nanobots within us. I think this might happen. I was recently invited to Blue Origin (a privately funded aerospace manufacturer founded by Jeff Bezos). I sat in their New Shepard spacecraft. Billions of dollars are spent on outer-space exploration. We are running out of resources on this planet. As our civilisation advances, our energy needs grows. We will run out of resources in the next 40 to 50 years. We might go to Mars or we will create colonies in outer space closer to Earth. But we also need to protect this planet. Astronauts, who have gone out of this planet, across geographies and decades have one thing in common: they return with much more appreciation and love for Earth.It can\u2026 but I am an optimist. I believe, as a civilisation, we are maturing. There has been much less war and conflict now than during any time in the past. There is so much out there today. We are talking about going to Mars. So, I don\u2019t see a large-scale conflict arising soon. Well, yes and no. Time is relative. Time on the moon, Earth and Mars are all different. People would age differently. So, time travel won\u2019t happen in the way where I can go back and meet my grandfather. But we might overcome certain speed barriers. And, perhaps we will be able to discover new dimensions. We have limitations on our visual and audio spectrum. With technology\u2019s help we\u2019d be able to overcome them as well. And, it\u2019s already happening \u2014 we can now see far greater distances than our vision allows, we can hear a bat\u2019s signal.I am sure humans are becoming immortal. We will either genetically modify ourselves or use implants that modify our capabilities. Gene modifying technologies are at the application level already, not even at the testing stage. But our policies, ethics and politics might not be ready for it yet. We keep making stuff but we don\u2019t know how to deal with them. We are totally unprepared for the changes.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

        "\nVR and AR to the fore at SubliMotion in Ibiza, Spain \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSubliMotion  Dining at SubliMotion is said to be a mind-blowing multi-sensory experience. Touted to be the most expensive restaurant, SubliMotion in Ibiza, Spain, is the brainchild of 2-Michelin-star chef Paco Roncero. A typical meal at SubliMotion is 20 courses long, lasts three hours and costs upwards of $2,000 per person. Diners experience everything from a video intro that diners describe as akin to time-travelling amid 360-degree projections. Sounds like something out of The Jetsons.SubliMotion, to put it succinctly, is the perfect example of how technology, on so many levels, has pervaded the food industry. In fact, the very vernacular around dining has evolved because of it; at these establishments, you are no longer considered a mere \u2018diner\u2019, but a consumer, as you\u2019re immersed in these experiences.Don\u2019t worry though, you don\u2019t need to break the bank to experience the magical duet of technology and food.Closer home, you have Loft, a Zee5 Experience, with its host of caf\u00e9s across multiple Indian cities, and its proud use of gadgetry to pull in diners. They have everything from Xbox and PlayStation consoles to a smoothie cycle (you\u2019ve got to pedal the cycle to power the blender that makes your smoothie) to keep diners engaged. These are ways to engage consumers in more ways than one, points out Ali Zaidi, business head at Loft. He continues, \u201cWith the consumer attention span getting leaner by the day, it becomes very important to keep them occupied. One of the most effective ways for us to introduce this novel experience in our caf\u00e9s was through the infusion of technology and games into our offerings.\u201d Loft also conducts game nights at an outlet level and hosts a gamut of workshops and events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoothie-cycle at Zee5 Loft Experience \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile tablets and iPods might not generate much interest, there are restaurant owners who\u2019re upping the ante with interactive tables. Mumbai-based Drinx Exchange\u2019s interactive tables allow diners to tap the table for everything from cricket scores to paying the bill. The screen also gives them offers on drinks available at the bar. At Chennai\u2019s Robot restaurant, robots have replaced waiters, as the droids move around the restaurants speaking to diners and carrying trays of food to respective tables. At Robo Kitchen in Hyderabad, robots simply deliver your food while waiters take your order.The Beer Caf\u00e9, which has branches across multiple Indian cities, has been using technology for quite some time now to keep their diners engaged. With Brew Miles that diners can rack up on their app, to URBAR which allows them to access a virtual bar, the caf\u00e9 has been playing the technology game right. Diners can pay ahead for a set amount of their favourite beverages and use the app to scan the QR code at any Beer Caf\u00e9 to get served.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Beer Caf\u00e9 in Saket \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology has been making its presence felt even at franchised and budget restaurants, with simple things like tablet devices and iPods being used for everything from browsing menus, to taking orders and feedback. Then there\u2019s Dash, a tool that lets diners taste, or rather experience, the food even before they\u2019ve ordered it at a restaurant. Sounds impossible. Monica Narula, who headed food programming at NDTV for several years and the brain behind Dash, says that the idea to create 15-second videos (or \u2018fideos\u2019) of dishes being served at restaurants came about when, \u201cpeople expected me to know everything about every dish just because I was into food programming\u201d. That\u2019s when she along with two other colleagues, Gunjan Mehrish and Noopur Tiwari decided to create \u201ctrailers of food offered at restaurants.\u201d\u201cThese videos take them through the complexities of creating a dish, the flavours and textures one can expect, and also throws in trivia related to the food. It works as food porn,\u201d says Monica, \u201cIn that sense, Dash is not an app, it\u2019s an appetiser.\u201d In the three years since its launch, Dash is now being used by over 40 brands, including Taj, Marriott, ITC, Mamagoto and Dhaba.An interesting trivia? Dash as an idea impressed Ratan Tata so much that he became a seed investor in the company.Printer\u2019s got your foodIn the last few years, 3D printing has really taken off in the food industry. There have been several reports of even NASA 3D printing food (where the \u2018D\u2019 stands for \u2018dining\u2019) including a pizza. While this might seem like it is straight out of a sci-fi movie, edible 3D printing is becoming more popular with both the food industry and consumers. Most food 3D printers use extrusion technology that engages paste-type ingredients. Some of the most commonly printed foods are chocolate, pancakes and pizzas.Along similar lines, but making use of Augmented Reality (AR) is Yeppar. Launched in 2016, the company began designing menus using AR for restaurants across the country. Today, with over 200 restaurants on board across India, Lisbon, Shanghai and UAE, Yeppar provides diners a realistic image of what their food will be like. \u201cWe\u2019re all about integrating AR in experiential marketing. Our AR menus help people visualise what a dish will look like at a restaurant,\u201d says Ankush Sharma, CEO of Yeppar. \u201cOften, you read about a dish on the menu, but despite the description, what one gets might be very different from what one expects. Since you can\u2019t really return food once ordered, it helps to be able to visualise it before you order. Yeppar provides diners a 3D image of the food, ingredients, nutritional value and also what to pair it with to help them arrive at a decision.\u201dAnkush believes that one of the biggest challenges faced by retail these days is not the quality of products, but how to best engage customers. \u201cTechnology excites people and can offer a lot of gimmicks. Earlier restaurants would have live ghazals; that might be pass\u00e9 now. But given the technology-driven world we live in, it is the perfect way to provide people with a wholesome experience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe successfully-tested drones for food pick-up by Zomato\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement  \n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are the drones. In December last year, Zomato acquired TechEagle, a Lucknow-based drone startup, to help it create a \u201chub-to-hub delivery network powered by hybrid multi-motor drones\u201d. A couple of weeks ago, they also successfully tested this technology. The drone could cover a distance of five kilometres at a speed of 80 kilometres per hours with a payload of five kilograms. The test was carried out as per DGCA norms. The drone has inbuilt sensors and an onboard computer to sense and avoid hurdles. It is also capable of taking off vertically like a helicopter.If all goes well, the next time you order food, you\u2019ll have a drone hovering outside your door.

        "\nKhushbu Sundar\n\u00a0 A day after actor-turned-politician Kushboo complained on her Twitter handle about a container lorry parked in the corner of her street, the Chennai City traffic police swung into action and impounded the vehicle. On June 22, Ms. Kushboo tweeted along with pictures: \u201cthis container has been parked at the corner of our street for the last 10 days, not even a single citizen around that has even bothered to check or complain.. it raises suspicion as it doesn\u2019t even have a number plate. Urge @chennaipolice to kindly look into it immediately.\u201d A day after, there was a response from the Chennai Traffic Police\u2019s Twitter handle @CCTPolice_Alert asking her for the location. On Sunday, the police replied that the vehicle was impounded and requested her to download the GCTP citizen services app. \u201cI appreciate their prompt response. It was at the end of my street. You cannot turn a blind eye to such a thing,\u201d she said.The traffic police took to Twitter in June 2017 and have over 9,500 followers.
